Effective Date: 03/05/2025  

> **Reference Only — Not Part of Condition Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines Freddie Mac’s requirements for **authorized changes or modifications** to Uniform Instruments, including riders, addendums, and specific use for Construction Conversion or Renovation Mortgages.  
These requirements govern **form structure and documentation standards**, not eligibility or conditional underwriting logic.

---

## (a) Uniform Instrument Changes and Modifications
The Seller must not make any changes or additions to the Uniform Instruments that have any force or effect after Freddie Mac purchases the Mortgage, except for those that:

- Are accomplished through **Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform Instrument Riders**  
- Pertain to an assumption or alteration of the **principal, Note Rate, payment amount/date, or maturity date** of the Mortgage  
- Are **required or permitted by Exhibit 5A**, *Authorized Changes to Notes, Riders, Security Instruments, and the Uniform Residential Loan Application*

---

## (b) Addendums or Riders
If permitted changes or additions are made in the form of an addendum or rider, the document must:

1. Be referenced in the instrument it modifies  
2. Reference the instrument itself  
3. Be firmly attached to the instrument  

The Seller must not make any changes or additions that would **adversely affect the negotiability of the Note.**

---

## (c) Modifications for Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages
The Uniform Instruments may require modification for use with Construction Conversion or Renovation Mortgages.  
Sellers may make necessary changes or additions through a **Note addendum or Security Instrument rider**, provided they:

- Are required to ensure **first-lien priority**, or  
- Cease to be effective before the **Settlement Date**

**Note:** See Section 4602.3 for documentation of Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages.
