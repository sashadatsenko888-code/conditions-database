Section: 5201.1 - Credit Reputation, Capacity, and Collateral Overview  
Effective Date: 08/06/2025  

Condition #1:  
Overview of credit reputation, capacity, and collateral.  
When underwriting a Mortgage, the Seller must determine, in compliance with the requirements in the Guide and Purchase Documents, that the Borrower is creditworthy (i.e., has acceptable credit reputation and capacity) and that the Mortgaged Premises (i.e., collateral) is adequate for the transaction.  
Credit reputation, capacity, and collateral are collectively referred to as the “three Cs” of underwriting.  
When any one of these components does not comply with the Guide requirements or if there is excessive layering of risk across components, the Mortgage is not eligible for sale to Freddie Mac.  

Condition #2:  
Documentation requirements for creditworthiness.  
All information used to evaluate the creditworthiness of the Borrower must be supported by documentation in the Mortgage file.  
The documentation must be obtained before, as applicable, the Note Date or:  
- For Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages, the Effective Date of Permanent Financing.  
- For Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages, the modification date.  
- For Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages, the Conversion Date.  
- The date of the applicable assumption agreement.  

Condition #3:  
Number of Borrowers.  
Freddie Mac does not limit the number of Borrowers on a Mortgage or require that they be related.  
The overall creditworthiness of each Borrower, and all Borrowers collectively, must be evaluated.  
The presence of more than one Borrower helps to reduce risk.  

Notes:  
- Refer to Chapter 5202 for detailed credit score and credit history requirements.  
- All “three Cs” (credit, capacity, and collateral) must meet Freddie Mac’s eligibility standards.
