Condition #3:  
Required FICO score versions.

Each CRA uses a specific version of the FICO model. The following versions must be used to determine **Underwriting** and **Indicator Scores**:

All three versions are based on the same core FICO algorithm and are required for uniformity across Borrowers and Mortgages.
