### Examples of Proper Classification
**Example 1 – Established Project with Streamlined Review**  
When a project qualifies under both categories, classify as **Streamlined Review**.  
Select **Established Project** only if a **Full Review** is required instead.

**Example 2 – Mixed Attached / Detached Project**  
If a project contains attached, detached, and semi-detached units and the ULDD Data Point **Project Attachment Type (Sort ID 41)** = “Attached,” the Seller may perform a Streamlined Review (§ 5701.4) and must select **Streamlined Review** on Form 1077.  
Select **Exempt From Review** and enter “Detached Project” for Sort ID 41 only if the project meets the Glossary definition of a **Detached Condominium Project** (i.e., comprised solely of Detached Units).

**Reciprocal Reviews:**  
When identified as “Reciprocal Review,” the Seller must provide the appropriate project identifier:  
- For **Fannie Mae-approved / certified** projects – enter the **CPM Project ID#** in the “Fannie Mae Condo Project Manager™ Project ID” field.  
- For **FHA-approved** projects – mark as “Reciprocal review and FHA-Approved.”

## (b) Homeowners Association (HOA) Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs)
- Sellers are encouraged to obtain and deliver the **HOA TIN(s)** whenever available.  
- See § 6302.20(b)(i) for details.
