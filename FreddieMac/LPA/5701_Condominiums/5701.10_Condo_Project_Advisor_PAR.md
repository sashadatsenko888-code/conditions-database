Section: 5701.10 – Condo Project Advisor® (CPA℠): Project Assessment Request (PAR)  
Effective Date: 09/30/2025  

---

## Overview
**Condo Project Advisor® (CPA℠)** allows authorized Sellers to submit a **Project Assessment Request (PAR)** and receive **PAR findings** about a Condominium Project’s compliance with assessed project-review requirements. When Loan Product Advisor® (LPA) recognizes the subject address and the project has a PAR status, the **PAR findings** also display in LPA.

This section covers:
- Mortgages eligible for purchase
- Submission timing
- Mortgage identification
- PAR findings (statuses, changes, last findings)
- Assessed vs. non-assessed requirements
- Project Certified Submission (PCS) review process
- Documentation requirements
- Representations and warranties
- Delivery requirements

---

## (a) Mortgages Eligible for Purchase
To be eligible, the Mortgage must:
- Be secured by a **Condominium Unit in an Established Condominium Project**.
- Be a **Loan Product Advisor® Mortgage**.
- **Not** be secured by a unit in a project with a **Not Eligible** PAR status.

---

## (b) Submission Timing
- **CPA:** Submit the PAR any time during origination, **before** sale of the related Mortgage to Freddie Mac.
- **LPA:** Submit the Mortgage to LPA per § 5101.1(c).

---

## (c) Mortgage Identification
The PAR applies **only** to the Mortgage shown on the **Condo Project Advisor Feedback Certificate** or the **Last Feedback Certificate** (see § 5701.10(d)(iii)). The Seller must enter in CPA **either**:
- The **LP Key Number** (aka LP AUS Key Number / Loan Prospector Key Number), or
- The **Seller loan number/identifier**.

**Retail Mortgages.** The LP Key Number or Seller loan number entered in CPA must **exactly match** what is delivered in Loan Selling Advisor®.  
**Non-Retail Mortgages.** The LP Key Number entered in CPA must **exactly match** what is delivered in Loan Selling Advisor®.

---

## (d) PAR Findings
The Seller is responsible for compliance with **the last PAR findings** (see § 5701.10(d)(iii)). Freddie Mac **will not purchase** a Mortgage in a project with a **Not Eligible** status.

### (i) PAR Finding Status

| Status | Requirements / Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Project Certified** | CPA found the project complies with the **assessed** requirements tied to: Glossary definition of **Established Condominium Project**, § 5701.3 (**Ineligible Projects**), and § 5701.5 (**Established Condominium Projects**). See PCS process in § 5701.10(f). |
| **Green** | CPA found the project complies with all **assessed** requirements for the status. |
| **Yellow** | CPA found the project **does not comply** with one or more **assessed** requirements. The CPA certificate shows a **Proceed with Caution** section; LPA shows similar **Condo Project** messages. If a message indicates the project **may not be Established**, the Seller must first confirm it **is Established**; if so, the Mortgage **may** be eligible if the Seller fully analyzes and confirms compliance with the requirements identified on the later of the CPA certificate or the **Last Feedback Certificate**. |
| **Incomplete Assessment** | CPA could not complete the assessment. Mortgage **may** still be eligible if the Seller fully analyzes **all** project-review requirements (§ 5701.2(a)) and **all** general eligibility requirements (§ 5701.2(b)) and confirms compliance. |
| **Not Eligible** | CPA found noncompliance with certain review and general eligibility requirements. **Ineligible** for sale to Freddie Mac. (This status will surface in CPA, LPA, Loan Quality Advisor, and Loan Selling Advisor outputs.)<br>**Note:** Absence of a Not Eligible status does **not** mean the project meets all requirements or that any Mortgage from the project will be purchased. Seller must still ensure compliance with all applicable Guide requirements. |

### (ii) Changes to PAR Findings
- If the Seller (or a Related Third Party) becomes aware of information that could impact or conflicts with a project’s PAR findings, they must **email ProjectInfo@FreddieMac.com** within **5 business days** with specifics.
- PAR findings **may change** after a status is assigned and after last access; **before sale**, the Seller must:
  1) Confirm the **current** PAR findings, and  
  2) Ensure compliance with the **last** PAR findings (see next).

### (iii) Last PAR Findings
- If the **CPA certificate’s “Date Issued”** is **later** than the **“Date/Time Assessed”** in the LPA **Last Feedback Certificate**, then the **CPA certificate** contains the **last** PAR findings.  
- Otherwise, the **Last Feedback Certificate** contains the **last** PAR findings.  
- If CPA and LPA submissions occur on the **same day**, the **Last Feedback Certificate** controls.
