If the Mortgage or Project does **not** meet requirements for either:  
- **Project Certified status PAR finding (§ 5701.10)**, or  
- **Streamlined Review (§ 5701.4)**,

No more than **15 %** of all units may be **60 + days delinquent** on regular HOA assessments.

1. Include:  
   - An **inventory** of major project components;  
   - A **financial analysis** of current reserve adequacy; and  
   - A **proposed annual funding plan**.

4. Be **dated within 36 months** of the Seller’s project-eligibility determination (§ 5701.2(a)(3)).

   - Construction engineer,  
   - CPA specializing in reserves, or  
   - Other professional with proven experience.  
6. **Meet or exceed state statutory requirements.**  
7. Contain **favorable commentary** on the project’s age, remaining life, structural integrity, and replacement of major components.
