   - **New Condominium Projects** – Section 5701.6  
   - **Reciprocal Project Reviews** – Section 5701.9  

   > *Note:* If the Mortgage qualifies under **reciprocal review** (Section 5701.9(a)), compliance with Section 5701.3 (Ineligible Projects) is **not required.**

2. **Project-Review Expiration Timing**

2. The Condominium Unit is protected by a **title insurance policy** meeting **Chapter 4702** requirements.  
3. For Projects on **leasehold estates**, the lease complies with **Chapter 5704**.  
4. The **Condominium Unit Mortgage must be delivered no later than 120 days after the Note Date.**  
   - If not delivered within 120 days, the Seller must **update the project review** before delivery.  
5. The Seller maintains **written policies and procedures** to ensure compliance of the Unit, Mortgage, and Project with all applicable Freddie Mac and legal requirements.  
6. The Seller **retains all documentation** supporting the project review and must provide it to Freddie Mac upon request.
