## Overview
This section defines Freddie Mac’s expectations for **Seller assessment of Condominium Project risks**, the required **project review focus areas**, and key **terms and glossary definitions** used throughout Chapter 5701.

---

## (a) Seller’s Assessment of Condominium Project Risks
Freddie Mac requires that each **Condominium Project** undergo a **project review** addressing major risk categories that can impact both the **marketability** and **collateral adequacy** of units within the project.

### Core Risk Areas to Assess
The Seller’s Condominium Project review must evaluate the following:
- **Marketability and physical condition** of the project  
- **Marketability of individual units** within the project  
- **Financial stability and viability** of the homeowners association (HOA) and project  
- **Project-level litigation** that could materially affect operations or value  
- **Restrictions** on unit owners’ rights to **occupy, lease, or use** the property  
- **Ownership and use** of Common Elements and Amenities  
- **Adequacy of insurance coverage** for damage, loss, and liability  

### Seller Expertise Requirement
Freddie Mac expects the Seller to:
- Maintain staff that is **experienced and knowledgeable** in Condominium Project risk assessment  
- Apply **equal diligence** to evaluating the property as collateral as is applied to underwriting Borrower creditworthiness  

### Determining Acceptability
A Mortgage secured by a Condominium Unit is acceptable only when:
- The **Borrower is creditworthy**, **and**
- The **Mortgaged Premises** represents **adequate collateral** for the transaction.

If a Seller determines that an **Established Condominium Project** fails to meet certain Freddie Mac project eligibility standards but remains adequate collateral, the Seller may **request a waiver** under **Section 5701.11**.
