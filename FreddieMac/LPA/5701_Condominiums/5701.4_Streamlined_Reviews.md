Section: 5701.4 – Streamlined Reviews  
Effective Date: 03/05/2025

## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s requirements for the **Streamlined Condominium Project review type**.  
Streamlined reviews are available only for units in **Established Condominium Projects** and must meet all requirements of §5701.2 in addition to those listed below.  

When the Streamlined review requirements in this section are met, the Seller **is not required** to perform any additional review type (Established, New, Exempt, or Reciprocal).  

---

## (a) Project Type
The subject **Condominium Unit** must be located in an **Established Condominium Project** as defined in the Freddie Mac Glossary (§5701.1(b)(i)).  
Projects still under development or subject to additional phasing are **not eligible** for streamlined review.

---

## (b) Maximum LTV / TLTV / HTLTV Ratios
The Mortgage must not exceed the following **loan-to-value (LTV)**, **total LTV (TLTV)**, and **Home Equity Line of Credit TLTV (HTLTV)** limits based on **occupancy type** and **project location**:

| Occupancy Type | Projects **Not in Florida** | Projects **Located in Florida** |
|----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Primary Residence** | 90 % | 75 / 90 / 90 % |
| **Second Home** | 75 % | 70 / 75 / 75 % |
| **Investment Property** | 75 % | 70 / 75 / 75 % |

> *Note:* When the ratio cell lists multiple numbers (e.g., 75 / 90 / 90 %), they correspond respectively to **LTV / TLTV / HTLTV**.

---

## (c) Special Assessments
A project is **ineligible** for streamlined review if **more than 15 %** of all units are **60 days or more delinquent** in paying any special assessment.  

The Seller must verify the HOA’s most current records to confirm compliance.

---

## Additional Notes
- Meeting these streamlined criteria **satisfies Freddie Mac’s project-review requirement** for the subject loan.  
- Sellers **do not need to complete** any of the following review types when streamlined conditions are met:
  - § 5701.5 – Established Condominium Project Review  
  - § 5701.6 – New Condominium Project Review  
  - § 5701.7 – Exempt from Review  
  - § 5701.9 – Reciprocal Project Reviews
