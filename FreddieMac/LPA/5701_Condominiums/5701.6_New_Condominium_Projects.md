Section: 5701.6 – New Condominium Projects  
Effective Date: 05/07/2025

## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s requirements for **New Condominium Projects**.  
Projects and Mortgages must meet both **§ 5701.2 (General Project Eligibility and Review Requirements)** and **all** criteria in this section.

A project is considered *new* when construction or phasing is incomplete, fewer than 75 % of units have been conveyed, or unit owners have not yet assumed HOA control.

---

## (a) Project Completion Requirements
- The **subject legal phase** (or subject building) and any **prior legal phases** offered for sale must be **substantially complete**.  
- “Substantially complete” means **Common Elements** are finished, and units are complete except for **buyer-preference items**.  
- Each building constitutes **only one legal phase** regardless of marketing or construction segmentation.  
- **Marketing/construction phases** created for convenience **do not qualify** as legal phases.

---

## (b) Owner-Occupancy Requirements
- At least **50 %** of the total units in the entire project, or in the sum of the **subject phase + prior phases**, must be:
  - **Conveyed** or  
  - **Under contract** to purchasers intending to **occupy** as a **Primary Residence** or **Second Home**.  
- A single building counts as one legal phase only. Marketing or construction phases cannot substitute.

---

## (c) Project Budget Requirements
The current-year (or projected) HOA budget must demonstrate prudent operations and long-term sustainability.

### Minimum standards
- HOA assessments must begin **once the developer stops paying** project operating expenses — even if all units are not sold.  
- Once any non-developer owner begins paying assessments, the developer must also pay assessments on unsold units.  
- Budget must be **consistent with the project’s nature and status**, with:
  - Proper **operating and maintenance allocations**  
  - **Adequate insurance-deductible funding**  
  - **At least 10 %** of annual assessment income reserved for **capital expenditures** and **deferred maintenance**  

#### Replacement-reserve percentage
**Formula:**  
> (Annual reserve allocation) ÷ (Annual assessment income including common-expense fees)

**Exclusions:**
- Special-assessment income  
- Income already in reserve accounts  
- Incidental income not used for maintenance/capital improvements  
- Pass-through owner payments (e.g., internet, utilities)

**Alternative compliance:**  
If reserves < 10 %, Seller may rely on:  
1. **Reserve study** → § 5701.6(k), or  
2. **Working capital fund contributions** → § 5701.6(l).  

HOA may not derive **> 10 %** of budgeted income from leasing commercial parking facilities.

---

## (d) Delinquent Assessments

### (i) HOA assessments  
≤ 15 % of units may be **60 + days delinquent** on regular HOA dues.

### (ii) Special assessments  
≤ 15 % of units may be **60 + days delinquent** on any special assessment.

---

## (e) Compliance with Laws
The project must have been **created and maintained** in full compliance with:  
- **Applicable State condominium statutes**,  
- **Local jurisdictional requirements**, and  
- **All other governing laws and regulations.**

---

## (f) Limitations on Sale / Right of First Refusal
Any right of first refusal must **not restrict** a mortgagee’s rights to:
- Foreclose or take title under a Mortgage;  
- Accept a **deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure**; or  
- **Sell or lease** the acquired unit.

---

## (g) Conversions (of prior-use buildings)
For projects created by **conversion** from another use:

### Within 3 years of creation – Non-Gut Rehabilitation
An **engineer’s report (or equivalent)** must confirm:
- The project is **structurally sound**;  
- **Major components** (roof, elevators, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, etc.) have **adequate remaining life**; and  
- No evidence contradicting the above findings.  

### For all conversions
- All **rehabilitation work** (Gut or Non-Gut) must be **professionally completed**.  
- **Engineer review not required** if:
  - Gut Rehabilitation (complete structural rebuild), or  
  - Non-Gut Rehab > 3 years prior to legal creation.

---

## (h) Mortgagee Consent
Project Documents (or State law) must ensure:
1. **Material-adverse amendments** require approval of First-Lien mortgagees holding ≥ 51 % of unit votes.  
2. **Termination** or **use of insurance proceeds for non-rebuild purposes** also requires 51 % First-Lien approval.  
3. Implied consent may be assumed if a notified mortgagee fails to respond within **60 days** of **certified/registered notice** with return receipt.

---

## (i) Rights of Condominium Mortgagees & Guarantors
Project Documents, State law, or applicable insurance must provide **timely written notice** to all First-Lien mortgagees and guarantors of:
- Any **condemnation or casualty loss** affecting a material portion of the project or the secured unit;  
- Any **60-day assessment delinquency** on a mortgaged unit;  
- Any **lapse, cancellation, or major reduction of HOA insurance**;  
- Any **action** requiring specified mortgagee consent.  

---

## (j) First-Mortgagee Priority
Project Documents must not grant **any other party** priority over a first mortgagee regarding:
- **Termination or insurance proceeds**, or  
- **Condemnation awards** tied to the unit or common elements.

---

## (k) Relying on a Project Reserve Study
A reserve study used in place of 10 % budget reserves must:

1. Include:  
   - Inventory of major components;  
   - Financial adequacy analysis;  
   - Proposed annual funding plan.  
2. Validate that reserve allocations provide **financial protection comparable** to Freddie Mac’s 10 % standard.  
3. Demonstrate funding **meets or exceeds** the study’s recommendations.  
4. Be **dated within 36 months** of eligibility determination (§ 5701.2(a)(2)).  
5. Be prepared by an **independent qualified expert** (engineer, CPA, or reserve-study professional).  
6. **Meet or exceed state statutory standards.**  
7. Contain **favorable commentary** on project age, structural integrity, remaining life, and component replacement.  
8. HOA budget must include allocations aligned with study costs.

**Documentation:**  
Seller must retain both the **study** and a **written analysis** in the Mortgage file.

---

## (l) Relying on Working Capital Fund Contributions
If the Seller uses working-capital contributions in place of the 10 % reserve:

- Project Documents must **require purchasers** to pay a **non-refundable, non-transferable assessment** into a **working capital fund**.  
- Fund must support **periodic maintenance, repair, and replacement** of Common Elements.  
- Minimum contribution = **two months of HOA fees** per unit, due **at closing**.  
- Developer must be **in control of the HOA** at the time of collection.

---

## (m) Projects Sold with Excessive Seller Contributions
If a builder, developer, or property seller offers **financing or sales concessions** (e.g., rent-backs, PITI payments) in a New Project, those contributions must comply with the **Interested-Party Contribution limits (§ 5501.6).**

---

## (n) New Condominium Projects in Florida
Mortgages secured by **attached units** in **New Condominium Projects located in Florida** are **not eligible**, unless the project has an **“Approved by Fannie Mae”** designation in **Condo Project Manager™** (§ 5701.9(a)).

---

- § 5701.5 – Established Condominium Projects
