## Overview
This section outlines Freddie Mac’s **appraisal and underwriting requirements** for **Condominium Unit Mortgages**, including considerations for mixed-use projects, live-work units, Common Elements, and Limited Common Elements.

---

## (a) Appraisal Requirements for Condominium Units

### (i) General Appraisal Requirements
The appraiser must report the following details within the appraisal report:

- The **Condominium Project name**  
- Any **assessments**, including **special assessments**  
- The **property rights** associated with each comparable sale, and a comparison to the subject project  

The appraiser must also:
- Identify and evaluate the **Common Elements** and **Amenities** available to unit owners;  
- Comment on their **condition**; and  
- Analyze how they **compare** to similar projects competing in the same market.

**Comparable sales** must:
- Be drawn from **similar Condominium Projects** in the same market area; and  
- Compete for the **same purchaser segment** as the subject property.

---

### (ii) Comparable Sales Selection
Appraisers must follow the comparable sales-selection requirements in **§ 5605.6(g)** for:
- **Established Condominium Projects**, and  
- **Recently converted or New Condominium Projects.**

---

### (iii) Additional Appraisal Requirements for Detached Condominium Units
For **Detached Condominium Units**, the appraiser must:
- Use **similar Detached Condominium Unit comparables** from the same project or market area, where available.  
- If detached comparables are unavailable, the appraiser may use **other 1-unit detached properties not in a condominium project**, provided the report:
  - Justifies the use of those comparables; and  
  - Reflects the effect of **condominium ownership structure** on market value and marketability.

**All appraisals** must comply with:
- § 5604.1 – General Appraisal Requirements  
- § 5604.2 – Exhibits and Addenda Requirements  
- Chapter 5605 – Appraisal Report Forms and Content Requirements  

---

## (b) Underwriting Considerations for Mixed-Use and Live-Work Condominium Projects

### (i) Condominium Projects with Mixed Uses
Freddie Mac will purchase eligible Condominium Mortgages in projects that include a combination of:
> Residential, commercial, industrial, office, or institutional uses,  
**provided that:**
- The Mortgage complies with all **Freddie Mac requirements**, including:
  - The **Project Review** and **General Eligibility** requirements (§ 5701.2), and  
  - The **commercial/non-residential space limitations** (§ 5701.3(d)).

---

### (ii) Live-Work Condominium Units
Freddie Mac will purchase eligible Mortgages secured by **live-work Condominium Units**, provided that:
- The Mortgage complies with all applicable Freddie Mac Condominium Project requirements (§ 5701.2); and  
- The **primary use** of the unit is **residential**, with any non-residential use being **secondary**.

---

## (c) Underwriting Considerations for Common Elements and Amenities
All **Common Elements**, including **Amenities** and **Limited Common Elements**, must:
- Be consistent with the **nature and design** of the project, and  
- Be comparable to those found in **competing Condominium Projects** in the same **market area**.

---

## (d) Financing of Limited Common Elements
**Limited Common Elements (LCEs)** are defined in the Project Documents as portions of the Common Elements reserved for the use of one or more unit owners, but **not all** unit owners.

Typical examples include:
- Balconies or patios attached to a specific unit  
- Assigned parking spaces  
- Private storage areas or bins  

### Financing Rules
- LCEs **purchased as part of the Condominium Unit** may be **financed** as part of the Mortgage.  
- The **cost** of such LCEs may be included in the **sales price** and **loan-to-value (LTV) ratio** calculation.  

**However:**
- Only Limited Common Elements may be financed in this manner.  
- Facilities made available via **permit, license, or lease** (except in leasehold condominiums) **must not** be financed as part of the Mortgage.  
- The **cost of using leased or licensed facilities** must not be included when calculating the sale price or LTV ratio.
