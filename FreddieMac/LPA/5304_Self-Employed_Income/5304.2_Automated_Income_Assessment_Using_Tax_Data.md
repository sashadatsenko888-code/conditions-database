### (a) Overview  

**Asset and Income Modeler (AIM)** automated income assessment using **tax data** allows Sellers to determine eligibility for relief from certain representations and warranties related to the Borrower’s self-employed income.  

The Seller must obtain the Borrower’s tax data and submit all required information to the applicable System. Based on the data submitted, the System will assess for representation and warranty relief eligibility and return the results.  

Representation and warranty relief eligibility is contingent on compliance with this section.  

**Service provider** refers to a third-party provider designated by Freddie Mac.  

#### (i) Tax Returns Uploaded to a Service Provider  
- Seller uploads Borrower’s **federal income tax returns** to a service provider.  
- The provider produces an **Income Calculation Report** from extracted data.  
- Optionally, Seller may request **IRS tax transcripts** via the provider.  
- Loan Product Advisor® (LPA) compares tax return data with IRS transcripts to determine **data representation and warranty relief eligibility**, returning results on the **Feedback Certificate**.  

#### (ii) Tax Transcripts Obtained from a Service Provider  
- Seller may directly request tax transcripts via a provider.  
- LPA retrieves and assesses transcript data for income and data representation and warranty relief eligibility.  

#### (iii) Freddie Mac Income Calculator  
- Seller may enter tax return or transcript data into the **Freddie Mac Income Calculator**, which produces a **Freddie Mac Income Calculator Certificate** with calculated income and representation/warranty results.
