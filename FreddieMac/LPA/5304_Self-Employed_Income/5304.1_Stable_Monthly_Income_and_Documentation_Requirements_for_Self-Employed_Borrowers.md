### (a) Self-Employed Borrower Definition, Business Structure, and Verification of Ownership Interest Percentage  

The business structure determines how the business and self-employment income are reported to the IRS. Federal income tax returns for the business generally document the Borrower’s ownership percentage.  

| Business Structure | Self-Employment Definition and Verification of Ownership Interest Percentage |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Partnerships, S-Corporations, and Corporations** | • A Borrower with an ownership interest of **25% or more** is considered self-employed. <br>• Ownership percentage must be verified via business federal tax returns, including IRS **Schedule K-1** or **Form 1125-E (Compensation of Officers)**. <br>• If unavailable, obtain verification via accountant letter or similar documentation. <br>• If ownership is <25% in all businesses, refer to **Section 5303.1(e)**. |
| **Sole Proprietorships and Schedule C** | • Sole proprietorships are unincorporated; the Borrower owns 100%. <br>• Income and expenses are reported on **Schedule C** of the Borrower’s federal individual income tax return. <br>• No separate federal business tax return is filed. <br>_Note:_ For 1099 income reported on Schedule C, refer to **Section 5303.1(e)** to determine if income may be treated as non-self-employed. |

> If the Seller is aware of a business structure change within the past five years, refer to **Section 5304.1(i)**.

---

### (b) Loan Product Advisor®  

The Seller must indicate in LPA that the Borrower is self-employed when the Borrower meets Freddie Mac’s definition above.  
This applies in all cases where self-employment income or loss is used to determine stable monthly income for qualifying.  

For automated income assessment using tax data, refer to **Section 5304.2**.  

---

### (c) Self-Employment History Requirements  

| Topic | Requirements and Guidance |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Length of history** | A two-year history of current self-employment is generally required and must be documented on **Form 65 (Uniform Residential Loan Application)** and verified per this chapter. |
| **Less than two years** | Acceptable if income and employment are stable. The Seller must: <br>• Evaluate Borrower’s experience in the business. <br>• Document a combined two-year history of income in the same or similar occupation. <br>• Use the lesser of income from current business or prior occupation. <br>• Include written stability analysis in the Mortgage file. <br>• Consider risk layering and repayment ability. <br>• YTD financial statements or recent business bank statements may support analysis. |
| **Minimum documented income history** | Borrower’s federal income tax returns must reflect at least one year of self-employment income. |
| **Geographical relocation** | Evaluate market acceptance of Borrower’s product or service and provide written justification that income will continue at the same level. |

---

### (d) Business Review and Analysis  

The Seller’s business analysis must support that the business has sufficient liquidity and financial strength to produce stable income.  

Minimum review must include:  
- Analysis of **gross receipts/sales, cost of goods sold, gross profits, and expenses** for reasonableness and trend stability.  
- Consideration of **business tenure** and cash flow consistency.  
- Review of **financial statements or asset statements**, and, for partnerships/S-corps, **historical cash distributions**.  
- Optional liquidity ratio calculations using generally accepted accounting principles.

### (e) Business Income: Access and Use  

| Topic | Requirements and Guidance |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Access to business income** | No documentation required for: <br>• Sole proprietorships; <br>• Ordinary or rental income and guaranteed payments from partnerships/S-corps; <br>• W-2 income from S-corps/corps; <br>• 100% owned corporations. <br>Documentation **is required** when business income not reported on Borrower’s tax return is used to qualify. Seller must verify Borrower’s legal right to access the income and confirm no restrictions (corporate resolution, partnership agreement, etc.). |
| **Use of business income** | • Sole proprietorship: income based on **Schedule C**. <br>• Partnerships/S-corps: may use Borrower’s proportionate share of income (ordinary income, guaranteed payments) from **Form 1065 or 1120S → K-1 → Form 1040**. <br>Cash distributions may demonstrate liquidity but cannot be used as qualifying income. <br>• S-corps/corps: based on W-2 income, verified via **Form 1125-E** if applicable. <br>• Business income not on personal return may be used if the Seller confirms its withdrawal will not harm business liquidity. |

---

### (f) Income Calculation and Fluctuation Analysis  

| Topic | Requirements and Guidance |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Income calculation** | Must be based on review of **complete federal tax returns (Form 1040 + business returns: 1120, 1120S, 1065)**. Use **Form 91 (Income Calculations)** or equivalent. |
| **Income calculation adjustments** | Include, if applicable: <br>• Non-cash deductions (depreciation, depletion, amortization) <br>• Non-recurring losses (e.g., casualty loss) <br>• Loss carryovers <br>• Review short-term debts (<1 year) to determine if income should be reduced by them. |
| **Income fluctuation** | Analyze whether income has increased or decreased over prior two years. If significantly changed, provide justification and documentation proving stability for next three years. Additional years’ returns may be required. Refer to **Section 5304.1(g)** for further guidance. |

---

### (g) Additional Supporting Documentation for Business and Income Analysis  

| Topic | Requirements and Guidance |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Business financial statements** | May include profit & loss and balance sheet (YTD, quarterly, or annual). Can support liquidity and income stability analysis but not used directly to calculate qualifying income unless audited. |
| **Most recent tax return unavailable** | When current-year returns are unavailable, Seller may consider: <br>• YTD financials since last filing; <br>• Most recent 3 months’ business bank statements; <br>• Signed IRS Form 941 for prior and current quarters; <br>• IRS filing extensions (Forms 4868, 7004) and tax liability review; <br>• Recent W-2s, 1099s, or K-1s. <br>If stability cannot be confirmed, obtain most recent tax returns. <br>Refer to **Section 5302.4(b)** for age-of-return rules. |

---

### (h) Borrower Debt Paid by Business  

Refer to **Section 5401.2(c)(v)** for self-employed Borrower debt paid by the business.  

---

### (i) Business Structure Change  

If the Borrower’s business structure changed (e.g., sole proprietorship → S-corp), it is treated as the **same business** only if:  
- Borrower’s ownership percentage did **not change**;  
- No significant change in products, services, or location;  
- No negative impact on business revenue or expenses.  

Otherwise, it must be treated as a **different business**. The Seller must document the evaluation in the written income analysis.  

---

### (j) IRS Form 8825 – Rental Real Estate Income and Expenses of a Partnership or an S Corporation  

All rental real estate income and expenses reported on **IRS Form 8825** for partnerships and S-corps are considered **self-employment income**, regardless of Borrower’s personal obligation or ownership percentage.  
Refer to **Form 91** for correct proportional income/loss calculation.  

---

### (k) Self-Employment Income Not Used for Qualification  

| Topic | Requirements and Guidance |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Secondary self-employment** | No documentation required if Borrower qualifies using another primary income source. |
| **Primary self-employment only** | Obtain pages 1–2 of Borrower’s federal tax returns and applicable schedules (e.g., Schedule C/E) to identify any business loss. <br>• If loss is included in qualification → no further documentation needed. <br>• If loss is excluded → perform business and income analysis, adjusting for one-time events as applicable. <br>• If positive self-employment income is not used to qualify → no additional documentation required. |

---

### (l) Business Assets Used for Closing  

Withdrawals of business assets may affect operations. Seller must ensure that withdrawals used for **Down Payment, Closing Costs, or Reserves** do not negatively impact business stability.  
The Seller may review:  
- Current financial statements;  
- Last three months of business bank statements.  

The analysis supporting this determination must be documented in the written income analysis.  
Business assets must be verified in accordance with **Sections 5102.3, 5102.4, and 5501.3**.
