Section: 4402.1 – Common Requirements for Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages and Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages  
Effective Date: 05/07/2025  

---

## Overview
This section defines the **eligibility, underwriting, documentation, valuation, insurance, and quality control requirements** for two types of Mortgages:

- **Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages (SOCM)**  
- **Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages (SOMM)**  

Both refer to Mortgages where the Seller retains ownership after a **conversion** (e.g., ARM to fixed-rate) or a **modification** of terms.  
These Mortgages must fully comply with Freddie Mac’s eligibility, documentation, and risk requirements **in effect on the Delivery Date**.
