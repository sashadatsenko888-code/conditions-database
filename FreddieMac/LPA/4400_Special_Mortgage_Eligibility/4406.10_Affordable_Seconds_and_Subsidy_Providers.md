## Overview  
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s compliance and eligibility standards for **Affordable Seconds®, subsidy providers, and program administrators** involved in Mortgages secured by properties subject to **income-based resale restrictions**.  
It defines acceptable program structures, documentation, and restrictions to ensure proper management of affordable housing subsidies while preserving Freddie Mac’s rights in the collateral.

---

## (a) Affordable Seconds®  
**Condition Type:** Secondary Financing Compliance  

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Applicable Guide Reference** | Must comply with **Section 4204.2 – Affordable Seconds Requirements**. |
| **Subsidy Calculation** | When Affordable Second proceeds are used to **subsidize the property’s sales price**, the **difference between the unrestricted market price and the resale-restricted price** constitutes the **subsidy amount**. |
| **Restriction on Freddie Mac** | The terms of the Affordable Second **must not restrict Freddie Mac’s ability** to sell or transfer title to the Mortgaged Premises if it acquires the property through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu. |
| **Purpose** | Ensures that secondary financing programs support affordability without impairing Freddie Mac’s recoverability or collateral rights. |

---

## (b) Subsidy Provider as Property Seller  
**Condition Type:** Transactional Exemption  

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Eligible Role** | A **subsidy provider or program administrator** may act as the **property seller** or represent a **government agency** as the seller. |
| **Interested Party Rule** | Such entities are **not considered interested parties** under Section 5501.6; therefore, **interested party contribution limits do not apply**. |
| **Rationale** | Recognizes that government or non-profit sellers promote affordability rather than self-benefit. |

---

## (c) Non-Profit Entity Documentation  
**Condition Type:** Organizational Verification  

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Verification Required** | The Mortgage file must include the **IRS determination letter** confirming the entity’s **501(c) federal tax-exempt status**. |
| **Purpose** | Ensures legitimacy of non-profit subsidy providers and compliance with federal tax law. |

  - A **State or local government**,  
  - A **government-sponsored program**, or  
  - A **non-profit corporation** that is **legally chartered** in its State and holds a valid **IRS 501(c)(3)** determination. |
| **Program Administration** | The subsidy provider may **delegate administration** to:  
  - A **third-party non-profit**, or  
  - A **for-profit corporation** (if permitted by jurisdiction) acting as program administrator. |
| **Program Purpose** | The income-based resale restrictions must be imposed by government or non-profit entities to **create and preserve affordable housing**, including programs tied to **government-funded subsidy mechanisms**. |
| **Homeownership Support** | The subsidy provider or its administrator must **offer or partner** with at least one organization providing **home counseling services**. |
| **Representation & Warranty** | By delivering such Mortgages, the Seller/Servicer represents and warrants full compliance with all above requirements. |
