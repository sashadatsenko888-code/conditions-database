Section: 4401.2 – Underwriting Requirements for ARMs  
Effective Date: 07/02/2025  

---

## Overview
This section defines **underwriting and qualification requirements** for Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs) eligible for sale to Freddie Mac, including limits on initial rate discounts, required borrower qualification rates, and rules for buydowns.

Applies to all Freddie Mac-eligible ARM products (3/6-, 5/6-, 7/6-, and 10/6-Month ARMs) using the **30-day Average SOFR Index**.

---

## (a) Special ARM Qualifications

For **3/6-Month** and **5/6-Month ARMs**, Freddie Mac restricts deep initial rate discounts:

> The **initial Note Rate** cannot be **more than three percentage points (3.00%) below the fully indexed rate**.

This ensures the Borrower is not qualified at an artificially low rate that would misrepresent long-term affordability.

---

## (b) ARM Qualifying Rates

Borrowers must be qualified at the **minimum interest rates** shown below for each eligible ARM product. These rates ensure Borrowers can afford potential future rate increases under the ARM’s terms.

| SOFR ARM Product | Minimum Borrower Qualification Rate | Notes |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| **3/6-Month ARM** | Note Rate + Life Cap (5%) | Must at least equal the maximum possible rate during the first 5 years after the first payment Due Date. |
| **5/6-Month ARM** | Greater of (Note Rate + 2%) or the Fully Indexed Rate | Fully Indexed Rate = Margin + applicable Index (within 90 days of Note Date), rounded to nearest 0.125%. |
| **7/6-Month ARM** | Note Rate (if not HPML/HPCT) or Greater of (Note Rate or Fully Indexed Rate) if HPML/HPCT | See definitions in §4202.5. |
| **10/6-Month ARM** | Same as 7/6-Month ARM | — |

---

### Additional Clarification

**Fully Indexed Rate** = **Margin** + **Index value** (30-day Average SOFR)  
- Index value used may be from any time **within 90 days prior to the Note Date**.  
- Round to the **nearest 0.125%**.  

---

## (c) Buydowns

### (i) General Rule  
For ARMs with:
- **Financed Permanent Buydowns**, or  
- **Temporary Subsidy Buydown Plans**,  

the Borrower must be qualified **at the rate defined in this section**, **not** the reduced buydown rate.

### (ii) References  
- **Section 4204.3** – Temporary subsidy buydown plans for ARMs  
- **Chapter 4601** – Financed Permanent Buydown Mortgages  

### (iii) Ineligible Products  
**3/6-Month ARMs** are **not eligible** as:
- Financed Permanent Buydown Mortgages, or  
- Temporary subsidy buydown ARMs.
