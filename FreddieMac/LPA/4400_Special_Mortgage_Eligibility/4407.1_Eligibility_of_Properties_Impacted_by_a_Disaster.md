## Overview  
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s eligibility standards for **properties impacted by disasters**.

## (a) Property Eligibility  
**Condition Type:** Representations & Warranties  

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |

| **Eligibility Obligation** | The Seller must represent and warrant that each property securing a Mortgage sold to Freddie Mac complies with all **property eligibility**, **value**, **condition**, and **marketability** standards under the Purchase Documents and §5602.1. |
| **Policies and Procedures** | The Seller must have **written internal policies** to assess whether the Mortgaged Premises has been affected by a disaster (e.g., fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake). |
| **Assessment Scope** | If the property is a **Condominium Unit Mortgage**, the Seller’s assessment must include any damage to **Condominium Project Common Elements**, separate from the individual unit. |
| **Purpose** | Ensures that no materially damaged or ineligible property is delivered to Freddie Mac without prior verification and documentation of condition. |

**Condition Type:** Collateral Integrity  

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |

| **Eligibility Threshold** | The property damage must **not impair the safety, soundness, or structural integrity** of the Mortgaged Premises. |
| **Insurance Coverage** | The Seller must confirm and document that **all damage is covered by insurance** as required under **Chapter 4703**. |
| **Ineligible Properties** | If the property damage affects structural integrity or safety, the property is **not eligible for sale** to Freddie Mac until:  
  - All **repairs are completed**, and  
  - The completion is **documented** (e.g., inspection reports, repair receipts, insurance claim settlement). |
| **Representation and Warranty** | The Seller certifies that, as of the **Delivery Date**, the property is fully restored and meets Freddie Mac’s collateral standards. |
