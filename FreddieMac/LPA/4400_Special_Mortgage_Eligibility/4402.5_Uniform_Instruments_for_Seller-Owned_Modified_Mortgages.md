## Overview
This section defines the **documentation and instrument requirements** for **Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages (SOMMs)**, including the forms, acceptable variations, and conditions under which each document must be used.  
All documents must conform to Freddie Mac’s **Uniform Instruments** or be modified to contain **substantially identical provisions**.

---

## (a) Security Instrument  
**Condition Type:** Documentation Requirement  

The Security Instrument must meet **one** of the following standards:

| Option | Requirement |
|---------|--------------|
| **Uniform Security Instrument** | Must use the version of the **Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform Security Instrument** effective on the Note Date for the state where the property is located. |
| **Nonstandard Instrument** | Allowed only if it has been **modified to conform** to the current Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform Security Instrument for that state. |

---

## (b) Note  
**Condition Type:** Documentation Requirement  

The **promissory note** must be one of the following:

| Option | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Original Note** | The original **Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform Fixed-Rate Note** with the **loan modification agreement attached**. |
| **New Note** | Required if the modified Mortgage is **not a fixed-rate Mortgage**. The Seller must use the **applicable Uniform Instrument Note** as specified in § 4101.2 for the modified Mortgage Product. |

---

## (c) Loan Modification Agreement  
**Condition Type:** Documentation Requirement  

The **loan modification agreement** must be recorded **if necessary** to establish that the Mortgage remains a **First Lien**.  

It must include all of the following key terms:

| Required Field | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Effective Date | The effective date of the modification |
| Principal Balance | The current unpaid principal balance |
| Interest Type | Whether the rate is fixed or adjustable |
| Interest Rate | The new yearly rate on the modified Mortgage |
| Monthly Payment | The new monthly principal and interest payment |
| Payment Start Date | The date the modified payments begin |
| Maturity Date | The new maturity date of the Mortgage |

### Acceptable Instrument  
Freddie Mac authorizes use of the **Multistate Loan Modification to a Fixed Interest Rate (Form 5161)** if:
- The original Mortgage was a **fixed-rate** and remains fixed after modification, **or**
- The Mortgage is being **converted from adjustable to fixed-rate** using the Uniform Fixed-Rate Note.  

If a different instrument is used, the Seller must **represent and warrant** that it contains **substantially identical provisions** to Form 5161 and is appropriate to evidence the modification.

## (d) Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages Originated as a Construction Conversion or Renovation Mortgage  
**Condition Type:** Eligibility + Documentation Requirement  

When a Seller-Owned Modified Mortgage was originally a **Construction Conversion or Renovation Mortgage**, the following apply:

1. **Conversion to Permanent Financing** must occur **before modification**.  
2. The conversion must be **documented under § 4602.3**.  
3. The modification (after the Effective Date of Permanent Financing) must be **documented under this § 4402.5**.
