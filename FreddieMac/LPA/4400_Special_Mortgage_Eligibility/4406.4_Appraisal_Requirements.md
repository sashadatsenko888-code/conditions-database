Section: 4406.4 – Appraisal Requirements for Mortgages Secured by Properties Subject to Resale Restrictions  
Effective Date: 02/04/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section establishes **appraisal report requirements** for Mortgages secured by properties with **resale restrictions**.  
It ensures that property valuation appropriately reflects the effect of such restrictions on market value and that Freddie Mac’s collateral standards remain accurate and consistent.  

Appraisal requirements differ depending on whether the resale restrictions **survive** or **terminate** upon foreclosure or deed-in-lieu.

## (a) Appraisal Report Conditions  
**Condition Type:** Appraisal + Documentation  

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Disclosure of Restrictions** | The appraisal report must **note the existence** of any resale restrictions. |
| **Impact Analysis** | The report must **analyze and document the effect** of resale restrictions on property value and marketability. |
| **Eligibility for ACE or ACE+ PDR** | Mortgages on **age-based resale-restricted properties** (e.g., 55+ housing) **may qualify** for an automated collateral evaluation (ACE) appraisal waiver or ACE+ PDR per §§ 5602.3–5602.4. |

## (b) Appraisals When Restrictions **Survive Foreclosure or Deed-in-Lieu**  
**Condition Type:** Appraisal + Valuation Methodology  

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Valuation Basis** | Appraisal must **reflect the impact** of resale restrictions on property value. |
| **Comparable Sales** | Appraiser must use **comparable sales with similar resale restrictions** when available. |
| **If not available:** | Appraiser may use: <br>– Older comparable sales with similar restrictions from the same Market Area, or <br>– Comparable sales from competing Market Areas with similar restrictions. |
| **If unavailable:** | Appraiser may, with justification, use comparables **with different or no resale restrictions**, provided the rationale is documented in the appraisal report. |

---

## (c) Appraisals When Restrictions **Terminate Upon Foreclosure or Deed-in-Lieu**  
**Condition Type:** Appraisal + Hypothetical Condition  

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Valuation Basis** | Appraisal must reflect **the market value without resale restrictions**, using comparable sales **not subject to restrictions**. |
| **Seller Responsibility** | The Seller or authorized third party must ensure that **the Borrower and appraiser are aware** of the resale restrictions. |
| **Appraisal Disclosure** | Appraiser must include the following **required statement** in the report:  
> “This appraisal is made on the basis of a hypothetical condition that the property rights being appraised are without resale and other restrictions that are terminated automatically upon the latter of foreclosure or the expiration of any applicable redemption period, or upon recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.” |
