Section: 4406.5 – Determining Value to Calculate the LTV, TLTV, and HTLTV Ratios on Mortgages Secured by Properties Subject to Resale Restrictions  
Effective Date: 12/04/2024  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section defines how to determine **property value for calculating LTV, TLTV, and HTLTV ratios** when a Mortgage is secured by a property subject to resale restrictions.  
The methodology differs depending on whether the resale restrictions **survive** or **terminate** upon foreclosure or recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.

---

## (a) Value When Resale Restrictions **Survive** Foreclosure or Deed-in-Lieu  
**Condition Type:** Collateral Valuation + Eligibility  

### (i) Purchase Transactions  
| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Appraisal Report Obtained** | Use the **lesser of** the *appraised value* or *purchase price* of the Mortgaged Premises. |
| **ACE or ACE+ PDR Accepted** | Use the **purchase price** of the Mortgaged Premises as the property value for ratio calculation. |

**Formula:**  
\[
LTV/TLTV/HTLTV = \frac{\text{First Lien Mortgage Amount}}{\min(\text{Appraised Value}, \text{Purchase Price})}
\]

---

### (ii) Refinance Transactions  
| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Appraisal Report Obtained** | Use the **appraised value** of the Mortgaged Premises. |
| **ACE or ACE+ PDR Accepted** | Use the **estimated value** submitted by the Seller. |

---

## (b) Value When Resale Restrictions **Terminate** Upon Foreclosure or Deed-in-Lieu  
**Condition Type:** Collateral Valuation + Appraisal  

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Applicable Transactions** | Purchase and refinance Mortgages secured by properties with restrictions that terminate upon foreclosure, expiration of redemption period, or deed-in-lieu recordation. |
| **Valuation Basis** | Use the **appraised market value without resale restrictions**, consistent with appraisal requirements under **§ 4406.4(c)**. |
| **Appraisal Report Condition** | The appraiser must determine value using **unrestricted market comparables** and reflect the **market value as if restrictions do not exist**. |

---

## Example – LTV Calculation  

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Appraised Value | $300,000 |
| Purchase Price | $225,000 |
| Subsidy Amount | $75,000 |
| First Lien Mortgage Amount | $225,000 |
| **LTV Ratio** | **75%** (= $225,000 ÷ $300,000) |

---

## Compliance Summary  

| Category | Requirement | Condition Type |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Purchase – Surviving Restrictions | Use lesser of appraised value or purchase price | Collateral |
| Purchase – ACE/ACE+PDR | Use purchase price | Collateral |
| Refinance – Surviving Restrictions | Use appraised value | Collateral |
| Refinance – ACE/ACE+PDR | Use Seller-estimated value | Collateral |
| Terminating Restrictions | Use appraised unrestricted market value | Appraisal |
| Reference | Must align with § 4406.4(c) | Cross-Reference |
