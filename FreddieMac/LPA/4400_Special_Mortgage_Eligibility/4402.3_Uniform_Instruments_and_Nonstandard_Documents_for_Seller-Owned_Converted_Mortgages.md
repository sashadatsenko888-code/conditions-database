Section: 4402.3 – Uniform Instruments and Nonstandard Documents for Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages  
Effective Date: 05/07/2025  

---

## Overview
This section specifies **document and form requirements** for **Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages (SOCMs)** — including use of **Uniform Instruments**, **Convertible Adjustable Rate Riders**, and rules for documenting the **conversion of an ARM to a fixed-rate Mortgage**.

It applies whether the original convertible ARM was originated using **Uniform Instruments (per §4101.2)** or **nonstandard documents**.

---

## Core Documentation Required

Each Seller-Owned Converted Mortgage file must contain the following:

1. **Original Security Instrument** and **Convertible Adjustable Rate Rider**; and  
2. **Conversion Document** evidencing the ARM’s conversion to a fixed-rate Mortgage; and  
3. Either:
   - The **original Convertible Adjustable Rate Note** with the conversion document attached; or  
   - A **new Fixed-Rate Note** (must use the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Fixed-Rate Note per §4101.2).

---

### (a) Conversion Document

- Must establish that the ARM has been converted to a **fixed-rate Mortgage**.  
- Must be **recorded** if required to preserve **First Lien priority**.  
- Sellers may use **Freddie Mac Form 3180 – Multistate Agreement to Convert**.  
- If using a **nonstandard conversion instrument**, the Seller represents and warrants that:
  - It contains **substantially identical provisions** to Form 3180; and  
  - It is **appropriate** for evidencing conversion of a Convertible ARM.

---

## (a) Original Security Instrument and Convertible Adjustable Rate Rider

The **Security Instrument and Rider** must be one of the following:

### Option 1 — Uniform Instrument  
The version of the **Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform Security Instrument** for the property’s State (effective on the original Note Date), with either:
- Fannie Mae Uniform Convertible Adjustable Rate Rider, or  
- Freddie Mac Uniform Convertible Adjustable Rate Rider.

### Option 2 — Nonstandard Document  
A nonstandard document is acceptable **only if** it contains provisions **comparable to those in the Uniform Instrument** effective on the Note Date, covering the following critical areas:

| Required Provision | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Default and foreclosure rights | Must provide equivalent lender protection and process as Uniform Instrument. |
| Use of hazard insurance, condemnation, and hazardous waste provisions | Must align with Freddie Mac’s standards. |
| No waivers of homestead, dower, or similar marital rights | Required to preserve enforceability. |
| Security maintenance | Must include clauses preventing liens, encumbrances, or waste. |
| Borrower obligations | Must define payment, escrow, and covenant compliance duties. |
| Bankruptcy protections | Must preserve lender’s rights in borrower bankruptcy scenarios. |

---

## (b) Original Convertible Adjustable Rate Note

The **Convertible Adjustable Rate Note** must be one of the following:

### Option 1 — Uniform ARM Note  
The applicable **Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac Uniform Convertible Adjustable Rate Note** version **in effect on the Note Date**.

### Option 2 — Nonstandard ARM Note  
Permitted if consistent with Uniform Instrument requirements, and the Seller must review and confirm that:

| Provision | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| Late payment fee | Must not exceed maximum allowed by **State law** or the **Guide**. |
| Payment structure | No clauses allowing **skipped payments**, **grace periods after partial payments**, or **hardship grace extensions**. |
| Marital rights | Must not include **waivers of homestead, dower, or similar rights**. |

The Seller must perform a **document consistency review** to ensure alignment with Freddie Mac-approved ARM structures.

---

## (c) Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages Originated as Construction Conversion or Renovation Mortgages

For SOCMs that originated as **Construction Conversion or Renovation Mortgages**:

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Interim to Permanent Conversion | Must occur **before** converting from ARM to fixed-rate. |
| Documentation of Interim Conversion | Must comply with §4602.3 (Construction Conversion and Renovation documentation). |
| ARM to Fixed-Rate Conversion | Must comply with this section (4402.3). |
| Combined Compliance | Both §4602.3 and §4402.3 documentation must be retained in the Mortgage file. |

---

## Compliance Summary

| Category | Requirement |
|-----------|--------------|
| Conversion Form | Freddie Mac Form 3180 or equivalent with identical terms |
| Security Instrument | Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Uniform Instrument (or comparable nonstandard) |
| Rider | Convertible Adjustable Rate Rider must be included |
| Note | Either original Convertible ARM Note + conversion doc, or new Fixed-Rate Note |
| New Fixed-Rate Note | Must use Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Fixed-Rate Note (§4101.2) |
| Nonstandard Docs | Must contain all protections of Uniform Instruments |
| Construction/Renovation Cases | Interim-to-Permanent conversion precedes ARM-to-Fixed conversion (§4602.3) |
