## Overview  
This section defines Freddie Mac’s **eligibility and delivery requirements for Mortgages with capitalized balances**, where unpaid interest, taxes, insurance premiums, or late charges have been added to the loan’s principal balance.  
Such Mortgages are **eligible for sale** to Freddie Mac only under specific conditions ensuring compliance, enforceability, and amortization standards.

---

## (a) Overview of Eligible and Ineligible Mortgages  

### Eligible Mortgages  
Freddie Mac will purchase Mortgages **whose principal balances include capitalized items** such as:  
- Interest,  
- Taxes,  
- Hazard insurance premiums, and/or  
- Late charges,  

**if** all general requirements in § 4403.1(b) are met.  

### Ineligible Mortgages  
The following are **not eligible** for sale as Mortgages with capitalized balances:  
- **Community Land Trust Mortgages**  
- **Mortgages secured by properties with income-based resale restrictions** that terminate upon foreclosure (or after any legally required redemption period) or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, where valuation must follow § 4406.4(c).

## (b) General Requirements  

By delivering a Mortgage with a capitalized balance, the **Seller represents and warrants** the following as of the Delivery Date:

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Legal Authorization** | Capitalization must be **permitted under the Mortgage documents and applicable State law**. |
| **Negotiability** | The **Note must be negotiable**, and the **entire indebtedness (including capitalized amounts)** must be **fully enforceable** and **secured by a First Lien**. |
| **Loan Amount Limit** | The **UPB (Unpaid Principal Balance)** including all capitalized amounts must **not exceed the original loan amount** in the Note. |
| **Capitalization Timing** | **No additional capitalization** may occur **after the Purchase Contract Date of Acceptance**. |
| **Amortization Term** | The Mortgage must be **fully amortizing** in substantially equal monthly principal and interest payments over 10, 15, 20, or 30 years—depending on the Pool term. |
| **Reamortization Rules** | If capitalization would cause the Note’s maturity to exceed Freddie Mac Pool term limits or create a balloon payment, the Seller must **reamortize** before delivery. |

### Additional Seller Warranties (if reamortized or extended)
- The Borrower has been **informed** that capitalization affects maturity or payments.  
- All **maturity date calculations are accurate**.  
- If a Borrower’s stated maturity extends due to capitalization, documentation confirming notice is required.

## (c) Delivery Requirements  
Delivery and pooling requirements for these Mortgages are governed by **§ 6302.22**.
