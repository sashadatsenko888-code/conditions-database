| 5/6-Month ARM | 60 months | Every 6 months |
| 7/6-Month ARM | 84 months | Every 6 months |
| 10/6-Month ARM | 120 months | Every 6 months |

**Notes:**
- Only **5/6-, 7/6- and 10/6-Month ARMs** may qualify as **Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans** or **Higher-Priced Covered Transactions** (see § 4202.5).  
- Consolidated summary of eligible ARM products is in **Exhibit 17S – Available Mortgage Products**.
