## Overview  
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s rules for the **distribution of excess proceeds** when a property subject to **income-based resale restrictions** is sold by either the **Borrower** or **Freddie Mac** following foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.  
It ensures that the **subsidy provider receives its contractual share** of proceeds while maintaining Freddie Mac’s rights to recover all secured debts and REO-related costs.
