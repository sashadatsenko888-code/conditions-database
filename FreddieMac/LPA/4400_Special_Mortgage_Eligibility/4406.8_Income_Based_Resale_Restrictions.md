Section: 4406.8 – Mortgages Secured by Properties Subject to Income-Based Resale Restrictions  
Effective Date: 12/04/2024  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section outlines Freddie Mac’s **eligibility and underwriting requirements** for Mortgages secured by properties subject to **income-based resale restrictions**.  
Such programs are designed to promote **affordable homeownership** by maintaining housing availability for low-, very low-, and moderate-income households.

---

## (a) Income-Based Resale Restrictions  
**Condition Type:** Program Eligibility + Collateral Valuation  

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Purpose of Restriction** | Income-based resale restrictions are used in affordable housing programs to maintain affordability and limit resale prices. |
| **Program Source** | Typically derived from **state or local inclusionary housing policies** requiring a portion of properties in a development to be reserved for eligible income tiers. |
| **Mechanism** | The **initial and subsequent resale prices** are capped below market value. This differential represents a **subsidy benefit** to the homeowner. |
| **Effect on Market Value** | The resale-restricted price defines the property’s effective collateral value for loan qualification and LTV purposes. |

---

## (b) Mortgage Purpose  
**Condition Type:** Transaction Eligibility  

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Eligible Transaction Types** | Purchase, “no cash-out” refinance, or cash-out refinance. |
| **Approval Requirement** | For “no cash-out” or cash-out refinance Mortgages, **prior written approval** is required from the **subsidy provider or program administrator**. |
| **Documentation** | The Mortgage file must include written approval and, where applicable, the **approved amount of proceeds** the Borrower may receive. |
| **Permitted Use of Proceeds (“No Cash-Out”)** | Funds may be used to:  
  1. Repay the unpaid principal portion of the original subsidy that reduced the initial sales price, and  
  2. Pay any required share of appreciation owed to the subsidy provider under resale restriction covenants. |

---

## (c) Property Eligibility  
**Condition Type:** Collateral  

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Eligible Property Types** | 1- or 2-unit **Primary Residences** only. |
| **Ineligible Property Types** | **Manufactured Homes** are ineligible **unless** the home qualifies as a **CHOICEHome®**. |
| **Occupancy Requirement** | Must be **owner-occupied** as a Primary Residence at delivery. |

---

## (d) Borrower Eligibility  
**Condition Type:** Borrower Qualification  

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Program Eligibility** | Borrowers must meet **subsidy provider or program administrator** income and eligibility requirements. |
| **Income Limit Reference** | When the First Lien is a **Home Possible®** or **Refi Possible®** Mortgage, the Seller must use **Freddie Mac’s Home Possible or Refi Possible income limits**—even if different from the program’s local limits. |
| **Purpose** | Ensures consistency between Freddie Mac’s credit risk standards and local affordable housing eligibility rules. |

---

## (e) Down Payments  
**Condition Type:** Loan Structuring  

| Requirement | Freddie Mac Standard |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Calculation Basis** | The **Down Payment** is based on the **resale-restricted price**, not the unrestricted market value. |
| **Purpose** | Ensures affordability is maintained while preventing over-leverage on subsidized collateral. |

---

## Compliance Summary  

| Category | Requirement | Condition Type |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Program Design | Must limit resale prices to maintain affordability | Program Eligibility |
| Refinance Approval | Written approval required from subsidy provider | Legal/Compliance |
| Use of Proceeds | Limited to repaying subsidy and required appreciation share | Compliance |
| Property Type | 1–2 unit Primary Residence only (CHOICEHome exception) | Collateral |
| Borrower Eligibility | Must meet program and Freddie Mac income limits | Borrower Qualification |
| Down Payment | Calculated from restricted resale price | Loan Structuring |
