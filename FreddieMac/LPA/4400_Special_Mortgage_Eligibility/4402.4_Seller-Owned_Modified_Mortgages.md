## Overview
This section defines the **eligibility, modification limits, and delivery standards** for Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages (SOMMs).  
These rules govern when and how a Seller may modify an existing Mortgage prior to sale to Freddie Mac.  

Negotiated underwriting provisions in the Seller’s Purchase Documents **do not apply** unless explicitly authorized by Freddie Mac.  
Such provisions **cannot be used** for underwriting or delivering Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages.
