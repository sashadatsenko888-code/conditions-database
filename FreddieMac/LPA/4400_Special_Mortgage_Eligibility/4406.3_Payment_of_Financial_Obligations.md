Effective Date: 12/04/2024  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section defines Freddie Mac’s requirements for **financial obligations and repayment terms** tied to **subsidies or payments** under resale-restricted property programs.  
These requirements ensure that any financial obligations associated with the property do not impair Freddie Mac’s **First Lien position** and are **properly reflected in underwriting**.

---

## (a) Inclusion of Recurring Payments  
**Condition Type:** Underwriting + Income-to-Debt Calculation  

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Monthly Subsidy Payments** | If applicable, **recurring monthly payments** associated with a **financial subsidy** provided when the Borrower purchased the resale-restricted property **must be included in the Borrower’s total monthly housing expense**. |
| **Underwriting Impact** | These recurring payments must be treated as **obligations** in the **debt-to-income (DTI) ratio** calculation under Freddie Mac’s standard underwriting rules (see Chapters 5100–5400). |
| **Documentation** | The Mortgage file must include evidence of the subsidy obligation, including payment amount, frequency, and source. |

---

## (b) Subordination of Repayment Obligations  
**Condition Type:** Legal + Eligibility  

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Subordinate Status Requirement** | Any clause or covenant in the resale restriction requiring repayment (partial or full) of a financial subsidy or imposing conditional payments **must explicitly state** that **such payment obligations are subordinate to the First Lien Mortgage.** |
| **Purpose** | Ensures that Freddie Mac’s lien remains **senior to all subsidy or repayment claims**. |
| **Compliance** | The recorded resale restriction or covenant must include this **subordination clause**. |
