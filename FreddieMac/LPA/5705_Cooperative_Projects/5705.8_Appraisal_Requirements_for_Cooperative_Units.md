## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s appraisal requirements for **Cooperative Units**, including the valuation of the **Cooperative Interest**, required data elements, and comparable sale selection criteria.

Appraisals must be reported on **Fannie Mae Form 2090 – Individual Cooperative Interest Appraisal Report** and submitted to the **Uniform Collateral Data Portal® (UCDP®)** in accordance with **Chapter 5606**.  
Each appraisal must receive a **“Successful”** UCDP status before the **Delivery Date** of the Cooperative Share Loan.

## (a) Cooperative Interest
The **Cooperative Interest** refers to the ownership interest in the Cooperative Corporation represented by the Cooperative Shares and the related occupancy rights, **excluding** the borrower’s Pro Rata Share of the project’s **underlying Blanket Mortgage**.

**Definition:**
> Cooperative Interest = Shareholder’s equity in the Cooperative Corporation (ownership and occupancy rights)  
> excluding the unit’s Pro Rata Share of the underlying debt.

## (b) General Appraisal Requirements for Cooperative Units
When appraising a Cooperative Unit, the appraiser must determine the **market value of the Cooperative Interest** and include the following information:

### Required Data Elements
- Number of shares attributable to the subject unit  
- Total number of shares issued and outstanding for the Cooperative Corporation  
- Lienholder name, lien position, amount, and repayment terms for all Blanket Mortgages  
- **Pro Rata Share** of the Blanket Mortgage payment attributable to the unit (unit shares ÷ total project shares)  
- **Pro Rata Share** of any other liens on the project  
- Details of **tax abatements or exemptions** applicable to the unit, including:  
  - Remaining term,  
  - Escalation provisions (future tax increases and timing)  
- Monthly **Maintenance Fees**, including breakdowns for:  
  - Utilities (if included)  
  - Special assessments  
  - Ground rent  
  - Other recurring fees tied to facility use (type, amount, and term)

This information may be gathered using **Fannie Mae Form 1074 – Request for Cooperative Project Information**, if utilized by the management agent, Cooperative Corporation, or project sponsor. The completed form may be attached as an **addendum** or transcribed into the appraisal report.

### Appraiser Documentation Standards
The appraiser must:
- Use **reliable, verifiable sources** for data on the project, the subject unit, and comparable properties,  
  and cite all data sources by name within the report or addendum.  
- Address **any factors that could increase the borrower’s monthly debt service**.  
- Report **monthly Maintenance Fees** for all comparable sales in the Sales Comparison Approach.  
- Report the **market value of the Cooperative Interest excluding the Pro Rata Share of the Blanket Mortgage**.  

#### Example
If the indicated value of the unit (including underlying debt) is **$100,000**,  
and the unit’s Pro Rata Share of the Blanket Mortgage is **$25,000**,  
then the **reported market value** of the Cooperative Interest is:

> $100,000 − $25,000 = **$75,000**

### Required Appraiser Certification
The appraisal must include a certification stating that the **Pro Rata Share of the Blanket Mortgage** has **not been included** in the appraiser’s opinion of market value.

## (c) Comparable Sale Requirements for Cooperative Units

Appraisers must assess the **market acceptance** of the cooperative form of ownership in the subject **Market Area**.  
This includes identifying the availability of comparable Cooperative sales and addressing any impact that limited market acceptance may have on **value and marketability**.

### (i) General Comparable Sale Requirements
- Comparable sales must come from **similar project types** with comparable Common Elements and amenities (e.g., townhouses, mid-rise, or high-rise buildings).  
- Appraisers must **use Cooperative Units** as comparable sales whenever possible.  
- If Cooperative Unit comparables are unavailable, **condominium units** may be used, with:  
  - A documented explanation of why Cooperative comparables were not available; and  
  - Adjustments to reflect the market’s preference for condominium ownership, if applicable.  
- See **§ 5605.6(g)** for Freddie Mac’s general comparable sales selection requirements.

---

### (ii) Comparable Sales – Established Cooperative Projects
When the subject unit is located in an **Established Cooperative Project**, appraisers must use:

1. **Two comparable sales** from within the same project (when available); and  
2. **One comparable sale** from a **competing Cooperative Project**.

If sales from within the project are not used, the appraiser must **explain and justify** why external comparables were selected.

---

### (iii) Comparable Sales – Recently Converted or New Cooperative Projects
For Cooperative Units in **New or recently converted projects**, the appraiser should use:

1. **One comparable sale** from the subject project (if available); and  
2. **Two comparable sales** from **outside** the project.

If no closed sales exist within the new project, use sales from **competing Cooperative Projects**,  
and provide a clear discussion of:
- The project’s **marketability**, and  
- Support for using external comparables.
