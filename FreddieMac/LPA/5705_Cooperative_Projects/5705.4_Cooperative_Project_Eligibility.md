## (c) Cooperative Project Budget Requirements
### (i) Financial Strength and Viability
The Seller must **underwrite the project’s financials** to confirm strength and viability.  
If the most recent budget is unavailable, the Seller may rely on the Cooperative Corporation’s **latest audited financial statements or corporate tax returns**.

Acceptable documentation must:

- Reflect operations consistent with the project’s nature;  
- Provide **adequate cash flow** for debt service and operating expenses; and  
- Provide **adequate replacement and operating reserves**.

### (ii) Negative Cash Flow
Negative cash flow for the current year must **not exceed 5 percent** of the annual operating budget and the prior year must **not** have exceeded 5 percent.

Acceptable if:
- The deficit stems from an **isolated expense**, or  
- The project has **supplemental income** (e.g., flip taxes / transfer fees / assessments) showing adequate cash flow.

If negative cash flow arises from **tenant-protected, leased or vacant units**, the sponsor/developer (or Holder of Unsold Shares) must:

1. Be **current** on all project obligations and any other project where they hold > 10 % shares.  
2. Not pledge Cooperative Shares as collateral except for the project’s acquisition financing.  
3. Provide Cooperative Corporation financial statements confirming **stability** and **no negative impact** from such cash-flow issues.

> Seller must retain documentation evidencing **adequate cash flow to service all obligations**.
