## (a) Seller’s Assessment of Cooperative Project Risks
Freddie Mac requires a comprehensive **Cooperative Project review** addressing key risks, including:

- Marketability and physical condition of the project  
- Marketability of individual units  
- Financial stability and long-term viability of the Cooperative Corporation  
- Pending or potential project-level litigation  
- Restrictions on Shareholders’ occupancy rights  
- Adequacy of insurance coverage protecting the project from damage or loss  

The Seller must maintain experienced staff capable of identifying and mitigating Cooperative Project risks and must treat the **Cooperative Interest** as equally critical collateral to the Borrower’s credit profile.

An acceptable Cooperative Share Loan requires two determinations:

1. The Borrower is creditworthy; and  
2. The Cooperative Interest represents adequate collateral for the loan.

## (b) Seller Approval for Cooperative Share Loans
To qualify for approval to sell Cooperative Share Loans, a Seller/Servicer must:

1. **Demonstrate Expertise** – Proven experience with Cooperative Projects and Share Loans, and capacity to manage project-level risks.  
2. **Possess Market Experience** – Substantial origination experience within the geographic market where Cooperative Loans are made.  
3. **Correlate Volume & Experience** – Production volume proportional to years of specialized Cooperative lending experience.  
4. **Maintain Qualified Staff** – Dedicated project-review personnel and access to legal counsel knowledgeable in Cooperative law and eligibility.  
5. **Maintain Written Policies & Procedures** – Covering project eligibility, pre-sale and owner-occupancy ratios, declining markets, completion standards, and layered-risk factors.  
   - Policies for loans sold to Freddie Mac must be **no less stringent** than those for the Seller’s own investment decisions.  
6. **Monitor Loan Performance** – Track performance metrics (e.g., first-90-day delinquencies, 60-day delinquencies within first three months).  
   - Implement corrective actions and evaluate results.  
   - Seller/Servicer must not have unresolved quality or servicing issues.  
7. **Provide Reporting and Documentation** – Deliver project-level data, underwriting documentation, or request Cooperative Project Documents from the Cooperative Corporation upon Freddie Mac’s request.
