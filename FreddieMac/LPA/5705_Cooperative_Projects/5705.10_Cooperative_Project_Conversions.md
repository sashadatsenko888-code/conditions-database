## Overview
This section outlines the additional eligibility and documentation requirements that apply when a **Cooperative Project** is created through the **conversion of an existing building** with a prior use.  
These requirements apply **in addition to** all other Freddie Mac Cooperative Project standards contained in the Guide.

## (a) Cooperative Project Conversions with Prior Use

### (i) Non-Gut Rehabilitation Conversion (within three years)
For Cooperative Projects legally created within **three years** of underwriting that involved a **Non-Gut Rehabilitation**, the Seller must ensure all of the following:

1. An **engineer’s report** confirms that the project is **structurally sound**.  
2. The **condition and remaining useful life** of major components—roof, elevators, HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems—are sufficient for continued residential use.  
3. All **rehabilitation work** was performed in a **professional and workmanlike manner**.  
4. There is **no evidence of adverse conditions** affecting habitability, safety, or marketability.

---

### (ii) Gut Rehabilitation or Older Conversions (over three years)
For Cooperative Projects that underwent either a **Gut Rehabilitation** or **Non-Gut Rehabilitation** **more than three years** prior to underwriting, review of an engineer’s report is **not required**.

---

## (b) Cooperative Project Conversion Documents
For a Cooperative Project created by conversion of a prior-use building **within three years** of underwriting, the Seller’s project review and eligibility determination must include a **comprehensive review of all Cooperative Project Documents**, such as:

- Offering plan or conversion plan  
- Declaration and bylaws  
- Proprietary lease  
- Engineer’s report and related inspection materials  
- Budget and reserve schedule  

For **existing Cooperative Projects** or **conversions older than three years**, a review of all project documents is **not required**.

---

## (c) Prior Cooperative Project Financing
For any conversion, the **mortgagee of the Blanket Mortgage** must:

- **Consent** to the property’s conversion and use as a Cooperative Project; and  
- **Acknowledge** that in the event of default under the Blanket Mortgage,  
  the lender’s remedies **will not extinguish the Cooperative Shares** of Shareholders who remain **current on their Maintenance Fees or assessments**.

This clause ensures continued ownership protection for compliant Shareholders even if the Cooperative Corporation defaults on its underlying debt.
