## Overview
All Cooperative Share Loans must meet the following eligibility requirements covering:

- Occupancy requirement  
- Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio calculation  
- Borrower qualification  
- Maximum Pro Rata Share  
- Subordinate financing  
- Flip tax (stock transfer fee)  
- Lien priority  
- Cooperative Corporation approval

---

## (a) Occupancy Requirement for Cooperative Unit
- The Shareholder must occupy the Cooperative Unit as a **Primary Residence** or **second home**.  
- The Shareholder’s right to occupy the unit must be supported by a **Proprietary Lease** that extends **through at least the maturity date** of the Cooperative Share Loan.

---

## (b) Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios for Cooperative Share Loans
**LTV Ratio = Original UPB ÷ (Lower of Sale Price or Appraised Value)**  

> *Note:* The Cooperative Unit’s Pro Rata Share of the Cooperative Corporation’s debt is **not included** in this calculation.

---

## (c) Borrower Qualification
When Maintenance Fees include utilities:

- The Maintenance Fee may be reduced by the **documented utility portion** before calculating:  
  - Housing expense-to-income ratio, and  
  - Total debt-to-income ratio.  

---

## (d) Maximum Pro Rata Share
- The unit’s **Pro Rata Share** of Cooperative Corporation debt must **not exceed 35 %** of  
  *(Pro Rata Share + lower of sales price or appraised value of the Cooperative Interest)*.

- May increase to **40 %** if supported by **significant compensating factors**, such as:
  - Strong project financials  
  - Large reserves  
  - Consistent positive cash flow  

- If the Cooperative Corporation has a **line of credit**, include the **full available amount** as part of the project’s total debt (Blanket Mortgage + subordinate debt).

### Example – Pro Rata Share Calculation

| Variable | Example Value |
|---|---|
| Blanket Mortgage Balance | $4,000,000 |
| Subordinate Financing Balance | $1,000,000 |
| Cooperative Shares Issued | 10,000 |
| Shares for Subject Unit | 40 |
| Appraised/Sales Value of Unit (excluding Pro Rata Debt) | $100,000 |

**Computation**

1. Total Debt = 4,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 5,000,000  
2. Debt per Share = 5,000,000 ÷ 10,000 = $500  
3. Unit Debt = 500 × 40 = $20,000  
4. Pro Rata % = 20,000 ÷ (20,000 + 100,000) = **16.66 %**

---

## (e) Subordinate Financing
Permitted **only** for Cooperative Units that are **Primary Residences**.

---

## (f) Stock Transfer Fee (“Flip Tax”)
Flip taxes are acceptable if project documents authorize them and one of the following applies:

1. **Seller Exemption** — Seller is exempt from flip tax if acquiring the unit:  
   - via foreclosure,  
   - deed in lieu, or  
   - other transfer in full/partial loan satisfaction.  
2. **Profit-Based Flip Tax** — Tax applies only to the portion of price **above the seller’s original purchase price**.  
3. **Flat or Capped Flip Tax** — Tax ≤ **5 %** of the Cooperative Interest value (lower of sales price or appraised value) and may be structured as a flat fee, per-share fee, percentage, or per-room charge.

## (g) Cooperative Share Loan Lien Priority
- The Cooperative Share Loan must be a **first-priority lien** on the Shareholder’s Cooperative Shares.

     - Blanket Mortgage payments, and/or  
     - Current-year property taxes.

---

## (i) Cooperative Project Must Be a Cooperative Housing Corporation
