Section: 6401.2 – Penalty for Nondelivery  
Effective Date: 09/03/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview

This section establishes Freddie Mac’s **enforcement rights and penalties** when a Seller **fails to fulfill a mandatory obligation** to deliver Mortgages under the **Cash, Guarantor, or MultiLender Swap** programs.

Failure to deliver, without executing an approved **pairoff** or fulfilling the contract, constitutes **nondelivery**, subjecting the Seller to penalties, suspension, or disqualification.

## (a) Freddie Mac’s Enforcement Authority

### Right to Take Action
In the event of nondelivery under a **mandatory delivery obligation**, Freddie Mac reserves full discretion to:

- **Protect its interests** and enforce its rights through any lawful means; and  
- Take **appropriate remedial or punitive actions**, including but not limited to:
  - **Disqualification** of the Seller from future sales of Mortgages to Freddie Mac.  
  - **Suspension** of the Seller’s eligibility to participate in Freddie Mac programs.  
  - Any additional **legal or equitable remedies** available under applicable law or the Seller’s Purchase Documents.

These measures are authorized under **Chapter 2301** of the Freddie Mac Seller/Servicer Guide, which governs Seller eligibility, approval, and termination.

---

## (b) Seller’s Option to Avoid Penalties

To remain compliant and avoid penalties for nondelivery, the Seller may:

- **Fulfill the delivery obligation** by selling the Mortgages as agreed; or  
- **Initiate a pairoff** (as outlined in **Section 6401.1**) prior to the Purchase Contract Expiration Date.

This pairoff action constitutes **fulfillment of the mandatory obligation**, thereby preventing classification as nondelivery.
