### Fee Assessment
- Freddie Mac calculates the pairoff fee and **quotes it to the Seller** directly.  
- The pairoff fee will appear on the Seller’s **monthly invoice** and must be **paid per Section 6303.2(a)** (Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment process).

---

## (d) Payment of Pairoff Fees

- All pairoff fees are **included in the Seller’s monthly invoice** and must be **paid in accordance with Chapter 6303**.  
- Freddie Mac reserves the right to **update the Loan Selling Advisor pairoff process** (including fee calculations and reporting) **without prior notice**.

## (e) Summary Table

| Type | Applies To | Calculation Basis | Request Method | Payment Method | Reference |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Pairoff – Purchase Contract** | Cash, Guarantor, MultiLender Swap | Commitment Amount – Tolerance – Delivered Mortgages | Loan Selling Advisor | Monthly Invoice (ACH per 6303.2(a)) | 6401.1(b) |
| **Pairoff – Commitment Amount** | Pricing Identifier with Mandatory Delivery | Commitment Amount – Tolerance – Fulfilled Contracts | Freddie Mac Account Manager | Monthly Invoice (ACH per 6303.2(a)) | 6401.1(c) |
| **Exemption** | Best Efforts Contracts | N/A | N/A | N/A | 6101.4 |

---

## (f) Practical Notes for Sellers

- **Best Efforts Contracts** are excluded because they carry no mandatory delivery obligation.  
- The **2.5% / $10,000 tolerance rule** ensures Sellers aren’t penalized for minor delivery shortfalls.  
- **Loan Selling Advisor’s pairoff calculation** reflects current market conditions — Sellers can realize gains or incur losses depending on market movement between commitment and pairoff.  
- **Automatic ACH deductions** streamline pairoff fee collection and reduce compliance delays.
