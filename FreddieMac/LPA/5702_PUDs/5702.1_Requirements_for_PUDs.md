## Overview
This section defines Freddie Mac’s eligibility and documentation requirements for **Planned Unit Developments (PUDs)**.  
Sellers must identify whether a property is located within a PUD and apply all applicable requirements for underwriting, documentation, and insurance.  

Freddie Mac defines a PUD as a real estate project in which:
1. Each unit owner holds title to the **lot and improvements** on that lot.  
2. The **homeowners association (HOA)** holds title to the **Common Elements**.  
3. Unit owners have **rights to use** the Common Elements.  
4. Unit owners **pay fees** to the HOA for maintenance of the Common Elements.  

> **Note:** Zoning alone does **not** determine whether a project qualifies as a PUD.  
> To be classified as a PUD, all four conditions above must be met.
