## (a) Overview

This section establishes Freddie Macâ€™s requirements and standards for the **Uniform Closing Dataset (UCD)** and the use of **Loan Closing AdvisorÂ®** for submission and validation.

The **UCD** is a standardized industry dataset that enables the electronic transmission of information from the **Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement**.

The following resources and components apply:

- **Uniform Closing Dataset (UCD)** â€” Common dataset format for delivery of closing disclosure information.  
- **Appendix I â€“ UCD Delivery Specification** â€” Defines XML formatting, field structures, and data standardization requirements.  
- **Loan Closing AdvisorÂ®** â€” Freddie Macâ€™s electronic collection and validation system for UCD submissions.

Loan Closing Advisor verifies that closing data conforms to Appendix I specifications, checking for:
- Completeness of required fields  
- Validity and consistency of data  
- Accuracy of key calculated values

## (b) Uniform Closing Dataset (UCD)

### Requirement
A **UCD XML file** with the **embedded Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement (PDF)** is required for **all Mortgages sold to Freddie Mac** with a **Note Date on or after September 25, 2017**.

### Delivery through Loan Closing Advisor
The submission requirement is satisfied when:
1. The UCD XML file is submitted to **Loan Closing AdvisorÂ®**;  
2. The file has received **data quality feedback messages**; and  
3. The **final Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement PDF** is embedded within the UCD XML file.

### Reference

## (c) UCD Messaging through Loan Closing AdvisorÂ®

When a UCD XML file is submitted to Loan Closing AdvisorÂ®, Freddie Mac provides automated **feedback messages** that help the Seller verify compliance with Appendix I specifications.

Feedback messages assess:
- Completeness and data integrity  
- Accuracy of calculated values  
- Consistency of information across all UCD data elements  

> The presence of **warning-level feedback messages** does **not** prevent the UCD submission from satisfying Freddie Macâ€™s delivery requirements.
