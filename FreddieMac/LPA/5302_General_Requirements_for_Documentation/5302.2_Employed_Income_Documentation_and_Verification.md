(a) YTD Paystub(s)

The following table contains requirements and guidance pertaining to YTD paystubs:

**YTD paystubs requirements:**
- The YTD paystub(s) must enable the Seller to determine and support the stable monthly income used for qualification.  
At a minimum, the paystub must:
  - Be dated no more than 30 days before the Application Received Date in addition to complying with the age of documentation requirements in Section 5102.4  
  - Clearly identify the employer’s name, the Borrower as the employee and the date issued  
  - Show the time period covered, the current pay period dates and earnings and the complete YTD earnings  

**YTD paystubs with less than required information:**  
When the YTD paystub does not contain the required information (e.g., paystubs that are handwritten or typed by the employer and do not contain YTD earnings),  
the Seller must verify the required information by obtaining additional documentation (e.g., written VOE, or a review of payroll deposits on bank statements).

(b) W-2 Forms and Alternative Documentation

**W-2 forms:**  
W-2 form(s) must be the complete Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-2 issued by the employer for the preceding tax year(s).

**Alternative documentation for W-2:**  
- Year-end YTD paystub(s) or military Leave and Earnings Statement may be used in lieu of the W-2 form(s) if the documentation reflects the complete income earned in the previous calendar year.  
- W-2 transcript(s) may be used in lieu of the W-2 form(s) if the transcript reflects the complete income earned in the previous calendar year.

- Signature, printed name, title and contact information (e.g., phone number) of the authorized employer representative who verified the information  
- The date the information was verified
