This section outlines general requirements for documentation used to verify employment and income.

Condition #1:  
Documentation requirements for income and qualification sources  

For all income and each qualification source used to qualify the Borrower, the Seller must obtain the required documentation and verifications listed in the respective income sections of Topic 5300.

Condition #2:  
Additional documentation when necessary  

Additional documentation may be necessary to evaluate, justify and explain the qualification of the Borrower.  
This includes scenarios in which the Seller has knowledge that the documentation originally provided by the Borrower may not be reflective of the Borrower’s current level of income, even though the documentation meets the age of documentation requirements.

Condition #3:  
Example — Updated paystub  

Example: A more recent paystub may be necessary if, after the original paystub was provided, the Borrower’s industry was impacted by economic conditions or widespread business closures that could affect hours worked and income received.

Condition #4:  
Mortgage file retention  

All documentation must be maintained in the Mortgage file.

---

Condition #5:  
Consistency across documentation methods  

The documentation requirements are the same for **Streamlined Accept** and **Standard Documentation**.
