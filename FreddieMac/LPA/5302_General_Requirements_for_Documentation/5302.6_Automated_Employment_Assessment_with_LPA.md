(a) Overview  

Representation and warranty relief eligibility is contingent on the Seller’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.  

Asset and Income Modeler (AIM) automated employment assessment provides Sellers with the option to use Loan Product Advisor® to determine whether the Seller is eligible for relief from enforcement of certain representations and warranties related to the Borrower’s current employment.  

The Seller must obtain the Borrower’s account or employed income data and submit all required data and information to Loan Product Advisor.  
Based on the data submitted, Loan Product Advisor will assess for representation and warranty relief eligibility and return the results of the assessment on the Feedback Certificate.
