Section: 5603.5 – Property Data Collector Independence Requirements and Seller Engagement of Property Data Collectors  
Effective Date: 11/06/2024  

---

## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s requirements for **independence, engagement, and oversight** of property data collectors (PDCs).  
It ensures that the collection of property data is performed objectively and without influence from sales or loan production activities.

---

## (a) Seller Responsibilities
The Seller is responsible for ensuring that property data collection complies with all applicable independence and data standards. Specifically, the Seller must:

1. **Comply with Property Data Collector Independence Requirements**  
   - Follow the standards in **Exhibit 42**, *Property Data Collector Independence Requirements*.  
   - Ensure compliance with all **applicable federal, state, and local laws** and with **Freddie Mac Guide** provisions.  

2. **Select and approve qualified property data collectors**  
   - Freddie Mac **does not select or approve** individual property data collectors (PDCs) or management companies.  
   - The **Seller or its authorized third party** must perform due diligence, approve, and select the PDCs.  
   - The Seller **represents and warrants** that all property data collection was performed in full compliance with Freddie Mac’s standards and applicable regulations.  

3. **Comply with the Uniform Property Dataset (UPD)**  
   - All property data collections must conform to the **Uniform Property Dataset** specifications and data format requirements.

---

## (b) Separation of Functions
To preserve independence and avoid conflicts of interest, the Seller must:

- Maintain **complete separation** between its **sales and mortgage production functions** and its **property data collection functions**.  
- Ensure that no individual or department involved in **sales, origination, or loan production** has any influence over the **selection, instruction, or compensation** of the property data collector.  

---

### Summary of Key Compliance Points
| Area | Requirement |
|------|--------------|
| **Authority** | Seller or authorized third party must select and oversee property data collectors. |
| **Independence** | Sales/origination staff must have no involvement in data collection. |
| **Data Standard** | Must comply with the **Uniform Property Dataset (UPD)**. |
| **Warranty** | Seller represents full compliance with **Exhibit 42** and applicable laws. |

Failure to adhere to these independence and separation requirements constitutes a **breach of Freddie Mac Seller warranties** and may subject the Seller to **repurchase, suspension, or enforcement remedies**.
