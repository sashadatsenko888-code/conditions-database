## Overview
This section outlines the **information the Seller (or its authorized agent)** must provide to both the **appraiser** and the **Borrower** when originating a Mortgage for sale to Freddie Mac.  
It ensures the accuracy and transparency of valuation and borrower disclosure processes.

---

## (a) Information supplied to the appraiser
For every appraisal request, the Seller (or an authorized third party) must provide the appraiser with all relevant and complete information about the subject property, including:

### Required information
- **Complete legal description** of the property (see Section 5605.3).  
- **Complete sales contract** for purchase transactions, including:
  - All **non-realty items** (e.g., personal property or furnishings conveyed);  
  - All **financing terms**;  
  - All **financing and sales concessions** provided by any party to the transaction;  
  - Any **gifts, buydowns, or down payment assistance** offered by third parties on behalf of the Borrower.  

> **Note:** For *new construction*, the sales contract must clearly state the **base home price** and **itemize each option or upgrade**.

### When updates are required
The Seller is **not required** to provide an updated sales contract to the appraiser unless the updated terms **impact the physical description or condition** of the property.  
If such changes occur, an **updated appraisal report** must be obtained.

Examples of **non-impacting changes** (no update required):
- Adjustments to **sales price**, **financing terms**, or **concessions**;  
- **Date corrections**, **typos**, or other administrative changes.

### Additional required disclosures
The Seller must also provide the appraiser with:
- Any **known affiliation** between the property seller and the purchaser;  
- **Income and expense statements**, **leases**, or **rental information** (for investment or multifamily properties);  
- **Energy efficiency reports**, if available — e.g.,  
  - Home Energy Rating System (HERS®) report;  
  - U.S. Department of Energy Home Energy Score report;  
- **Ground Lease agreement** for leasehold properties (see Section 5704.2);  
- Any other **information known to the Seller** that could **adversely affect** the property’s market value, condition, or marketability — including:
  - **Contaminated sites**,  
  - **Hazardous substances**, or  
  - **Environmental or structural issues** impacting the property or neighborhood (see Section 5605.4(b)).

---

## (b) Information supplied to the Borrower
For **purchase transactions**, the Seller must disclose to the Borrower:
- Any **environmental hazards** that directly affect the subject property and have **not been mitigated or remediated**, unless the Borrower is already aware through the **purchase contract** or a **property inspection**.

If, **at any time before the Note Date**, the Seller becomes aware of any new or previously undisclosed hazard that may **adversely affect** the property’s **market value**, **condition**, or **marketability**, the Seller must:
- **Promptly disclose** this information to the Borrower, and  
- Include all relevant details known to the Seller about the **nature, scope, and remediation status** of the hazard.

### Summary of Key Responsibilities
| Party | Information Obligation | Timing |
|-------|------------------------|---------|
| **Appraiser** | Must receive complete, accurate, and relevant data to ensure credible valuation | At appraisal order |
| **Borrower** | Must be informed of any environmental hazards or conditions affecting the property | Before Note Date |

---

Failure by the Seller to provide accurate or complete information to either the appraiser or Borrower constitutes a **breach of Freddie Mac’s Seller warranties** and may subject the Seller to enforcement remedies.
