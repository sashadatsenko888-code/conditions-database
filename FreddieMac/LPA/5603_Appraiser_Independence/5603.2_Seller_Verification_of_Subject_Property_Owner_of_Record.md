Section: 5603.2 – Seller Verification of Subject Property Owner of Record  
Effective Date: 11/06/2024  

---

## Overview
This section establishes the Seller’s responsibility to **verify, investigate, and document ownership of record** for all property transactions requiring a new appraisal report.

---

## (a) Verifying the Owner of Record
When a new appraisal report is obtained, the Seller must verify **ownership of record** as follows:

| Transaction Type | Seller Must Verify |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **Purchase** | • The property seller listed on the sales contract is the **Owner of Record** of the subject property; or<br>• If the transaction involves the sale of **land separate from the dwelling**, the property seller listed on the land sales contract is the **Owner of Record** for the land. |
| **Refinance** | • The Borrower is an **Owner of Record** of the subject property. |
| **Payoff of a land contract** | • The property seller is the **vendor on the recorded land contract** and the **Owner of Record** of the property; and<br>• The Borrower is the **vendee on the recorded land contract**. |

---

## (b) Investigating and documenting Owner of Record discrepancies
If the Seller finds that:
- The property seller (for a purchase), or  
- The Borrower (for a refinance)  

is **not the Owner of Record**, the Seller must:
1. **Investigate** the circumstances of the transaction to confirm it is legitimate; and  
2. **Document findings** in the Mortgage file, demonstrating that the ownership and transfer are valid.

Acceptable documentation may include:
- The **appraiser’s analysis and conclusions** in the appraisal report;  
- A **property sales history report**;  
- A **copy of the recorded deed**;  
- A **property tax bill**; or  
- A **title commitment or binder** indicating legal ownership of the property.

Failure to verify or document ownership discrepancies constitutes a breach of the Seller’s representation and warranty obligations regarding the legitimacy and eligibility of the Mortgage.
