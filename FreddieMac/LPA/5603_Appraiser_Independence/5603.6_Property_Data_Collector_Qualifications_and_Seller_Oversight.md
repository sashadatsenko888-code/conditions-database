## Overview
This section establishes the **qualification standards** for property data collectors (PDCs) and the **Seller’s oversight responsibilities** to ensure the accuracy, integrity, and independence of property data collection activities.

---

## (a) Property Data Collectors
The Seller, or its authorized third party, must ensure that every property data collector (PDC):

### 1. Maintains Independence and Objectivity
- Must be **independent and unbiased**, with **no present or prospective interest** or **conflict of interest** related to:  
  - The transaction,  
  - The subject property, or  
  - Any participant in the transaction.  

### 2. Meets Competency and Training Standards
Each property data collector must:
- Complete **training** in all aspects of property data collection;  
- Demonstrate proficiency in the **Uniform Property Dataset (UPD)** by **passing an exam** evidencing technical competence and data accuracy.  

### 3. Performs Complete and Accurate Data Collection
The PDC must perform all required property data collection functions, including but not limited to:

#### a. Identification and Reporting  
- Identify and document all **property characteristics** specified in the **UPD**, supported by photographs.  
- Identify and describe **design features** that **impair usability** or deviate from typical functionality (e.g., access to a bedroom only through another bedroom).  
- Note **atypical adjacent factors** affecting marketability (e.g., proximity to **power lines**, **commercial or industrial sites**, etc.).  

#### b. Measurement and Floorplan Requirements  
- Measure the **dwelling unit(s)** and all other structures on the subject property;  
- Produce **building sketches and floorplans** in accordance with exhibit requirements in **Section 5604.2(a)(ii)**.

#### c. Photograph Documentation  
- Capture and include a **comprehensive set of photographs** of the subject property as described in the **UPD**;  
- See **Section 5604.2(h)** for detailed **photograph content and quality requirements**.

---

## (b) Seller Oversight of Property Data Collectors
The Seller, or its authorized third party, is ultimately **responsible for the accuracy and reliability** of the **Property Data Report (PDR)** and all data provided by the property data collector to the appraiser.

### The Seller must have written policies and procedures that:
1. **Require periodic background checks**  
   - Including **criminal background checks** for all property data collectors.

2. **Mandate comprehensive training**  
   - Ensure PDCs are trained to prepare **accurate and thorough PDRs** that meet Freddie Mac’s quality standards.

3. **Enforce professional conduct**  
   - Require PDCs to adhere to the **same customer service standards or code of conduct** applicable to the Seller’s own employees or contractors.

4. **Implement continuous performance monitoring**  
   - Maintain an **evaluation process** to track and document PDC performance.  
   - Identify and correct recurring deficiencies.  
   - **Discontinue use** of any PDC that exhibits **chronic underperformance**.

5. **Provide continuing education**
   - Establish ongoing education programs, especially when there are **updates to the UPD**, procedural changes, or identified training needs.

6. **Include PDRs in quality control (QC) reviews**
   - Perform **targeted QC sampling** of PDRs to ensure reliability and data integrity.  
   - Include **hybrid appraisals** (those combining PDC and appraiser input) in QC sampling.
