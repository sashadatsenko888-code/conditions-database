## Overview
This section identifies **unacceptable appraisal practices** that violate Freddie Mac’s standards of professional quality, independence, and nondiscrimination.  
Evidence of any such practices constitutes a **breach of the Seller’s warranty** regarding the professional quality of the appraisal.

---

## Unacceptable Practices

### 1. Discriminatory or biased considerations
Appraisals must never consider or reference:
- **Race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, marital status, disability, familial status**;  
- **Exercise of any federally protected civil right** or **receipt of public assistance income**;  
- **National origin, birthplace**, or **ethnic composition** of current or prospective residents;  
- **Neighborhood demographics** or **protected class characteristics** of nearby properties or residents.  

> **Reference:** See Section **1301.2** for Equal Opportunity Compliance requirements.

---

### 2. Unsupported or subjective terminology
The use of **unsupported adjectives or vague qualitative terms** is prohibited, including but not limited to:  
> “high,” “low,” “good,” “bad,” “fair,” “poor,” “strong,” “weak,” “rapid,” “slow,” “fast,” or “average.”

All such terms must be **quantitatively or contextually supported** by data, analysis, or market evidence.

---

### 3. Biased or coded language
Appraisers must avoid **coded or veiled language** that implies bias or demographic preference, including terms such as:
- “Pride of ownership,” “crime-ridden area,” “desirable neighborhood,” “undesirable neighborhood,”  
- “Gentrified,” “working class,” “inner city,” “preferred community,” “up and coming,”  
- “Predominantly Hispanic/Black neighborhood,” “diverse school system,”  
- References to “Millennials,” “Generation X,” or “Baby Boomers,”  
- Descriptions suggesting amenities geared toward specific **racial, ethnic, or religious** groups.  

Such terminology is prohibited because it introduces **subjective or discriminatory bias**.

---

### 4. Use of inaccurate or incomplete data
Developing an appraisal with **inaccurate or incomplete data** concerning the:
- **Subject property**,  
- **Neighborhood or market area**, or  
- **Comparable sales**  
is strictly prohibited.

---

### 5. References to crime data
Appraisal reports must **not include any statements, comparisons, or references** to **crime rates or crime statistics**, whether **objective or subjective**, as such references may result in bias or misrepresentation of marketability.

---

### 6. Discriminatory use of property age or location
Appraisers must not consider:
- The **age or location** of a dwelling, or  
- The **age of a neighborhood or census tract**,  
in any way that produces a **discriminatory effect** or implies social, racial, or economic bias.

---

### 7. Discriminatory value development
Appraisers must not base valuation conclusions on any factor that **local, State, or Federal law** identifies as **discriminatory**.

---

### 8. Improper use of comparable sales
The following are prohibited:
- Relying on comparable properties that were **not personally inspected** when such inspection is required by the **scope of work**;  
- Using **inappropriate or non-similar comparables** without justification;  
- Failing to use **more relevant or proximate comparables** when available;  
- Using comparable sales data **provided by an interested party** without **independent verification**;  
- Applying **inordinate or unsupported adjustments** for property differences;  
- Failing to make necessary **market-supported adjustments**.

> **Note:** A personal inspection requires at least a **visual exterior inspection** of each comparable.

---

### 9. Unsupported conclusions
Developing an **opinion of value or marketability conclusion** that is **not supported by available market data** constitutes a serious violation.

---

### 10. Certification or report form violations
It is unacceptable for the appraiser or supervisory appraiser to **breach any certification**, **statement of assumptions**, or **limiting conditions** contained in Freddie Mac-approved appraisal forms or addenda.

---

## Cross-Reference
- See Section **5606.3** for **additional unacceptable appraisal practices** related to **electronic appraisal reports** and digital submissions.
