Section: 5102.2 - Loan Product Advisor® Mortgages and Manually Underwritten Mortgages  
Effective Date: 08/06/2025  

Condition #1:  
Loan Product Advisor Mortgages.  
In many cases, submitting the Mortgage to Loan Product Advisor is the most efficient way to assess Borrower creditworthiness and identify excessive layering of risk.  
Loan Product Advisor assesses the Mortgage based on the data submitted to Loan Product Advisor and provided by the consumer reporting agencies and returns a Risk Class of either Accept or Caution on the Feedback Certificate.  

Note: See Chapter 5101 for additional requirements for Loan Product Advisor Mortgages.  

(i) Accept Mortgages.  
For Mortgages with a Risk Class of Accept on the Last Feedback Certificate, the Seller is eligible for relief from enforcement of representations and warranties for creditworthiness and layering of risk when the requirements in Section 5101.2(a) are met.  

(ii) Caution Mortgages.  
For Mortgages with a Risk Class of Caution on the Last Feedback Certificate to be eligible for sale to Freddie Mac, the Seller must manually underwrite the Mortgage in accordance with Section 5102.2(b) below.

Condition #2:  
Manually Underwritten Mortgages.  
Manually Underwritten Mortgages are those for which the Seller evaluates the Mortgage information and data, makes the final determination regarding Borrower creditworthiness and layering of risk, and complies with the requirements of this Section 5102.2(b).  
To be eligible for sale to Freddie Mac, manual underwriting is required for all Mortgages that did not receive a Risk Class of Accept on the Last Feedback Certificate, including Mortgages never submitted to Loan Product Advisor.  

(i) Borrower creditworthiness.  
The Seller’s conclusion that the Borrower is creditworthy must be based on documentation included in the Mortgage file and described on Form 1077, Uniform Underwriting and Transmittal Summary, or another document in the Mortgage file.  
To determine that the Borrower is creditworthy, the Seller must manually underwrite the Mortgage as required in Topics 5100 through 5500 for the Mortgage to be eligible for sale to Freddie Mac.  
The Seller must determine that the Borrower has an acceptable credit reputation in accordance with Chapter 5202 and confirm that the Mortgage meets the minimum Indicator Score requirements in Exhibit 25, Mortgages with Risk Class and/or Minimum Indicator Score Requirements.  

The Seller must determine the Borrower’s capacity to repay the Mortgage and other monthly obligations by analyzing file documentation for the following factors:  
- Stable monthly income.  
  *Note: The Freddie Mac Income Calculator may be used to assess the Borrower’s stable monthly income and determine eligibility for relief from enforcement of certain income representations and warranties. Results appear on the Freddie Mac Income Calculator Certificate.*  
  For Income Calculator requirements, see:  
  - Section 5303.4 – Automated income assessment for employed income.  
  - Section 5304.2 – Automated income assessment for self-employed income.  
- Monthly housing expense-to-income ratio.  
- Monthly debt payment-to-income (DTI) ratio.  
- Reserves.  
- Borrower’s history of paying prior obligations.  

For Non-LPA Mortgages, the Seller must presume the Borrower’s capacity to repay is not acceptable when all of the following apply:  
- Cash-out refinance transaction.  
- Monthly DTI ratio exceeds 42%.  
- Any Borrower has an Underwriting Score below 700.  
- TLTV ratio greater than 75%.  

A Borrower who repeatedly consolidates or refinances debt to manage payments presents higher risk. The Seller should evaluate both short- and long-term repayment capacity.  

(ii) Layering of risk.  
For all Manually Underwritten Mortgages, the Seller must determine that the Mortgage is eligible for sale by assessing layering of risk.  
Multiple high-risk characteristics without sufficient offsets indicate excessive layering.  
Offsetting factors need not exist for every risk factor if overall risk is balanced, but when multiple risk factors are present, more conservative underwriting is required.  

Examples of characteristics that add risk:  
- Payoff of a junior lien from refinance proceeds.  
- Cash-out refinance.  
- Borrower with low or no reserves.  

The Seller must ensure each component—credit reputation, capacity, and collateral—is not excessive and that overall layering is acceptable.  
A single strong component cannot compensate for multiple weak ones.  
Example: A Mortgage with weak capacity but strong collateral and credit reputation may be acceptable; one with weak capacity and weak credit reputation is not.  

Even when each component is acceptable, layering of risk may make the Mortgage unacceptable.  
Mortgage characteristics (e.g., product type, purpose, property type) may add layers of risk.  

The Seller’s analysis of layering of risk must be documented in the Mortgage file and include:  
- Identified risk factors.  
- Identified offsetting factors.  
- Supporting documentation.  
- Written conclusion confirming no excessive layering of risks.  

(iii) Additional requirements for Caution Mortgages.  
Caution Mortgages indicate potential excessive risk layering.  
The Seller must analyze all risk factors in the Mortgage file, including those on the Feedback Certificate, and document offsetting factors not considered by Loan Product Advisor.  
Information already analyzed by LPA cannot be reused as offsets.  

Factors **not** allowed as offsets:  
- TLTV or LTV below maximum.  
- DTI or housing ratio below guideline.  
- Level of reserves.  
- Mortgage Product or property type.  
- FICO® score or any combination of these.  

The Seller must presume capacity to repay is not acceptable when the Caution Mortgage is a cash-out refinance and any DTI-related credit risk message appears on the Feedback Certificate.  

The file must document the overall conclusion that the Borrower can meet all current obligations, including the new Mortgage.  

Notes:  
- Caution Mortgages require full manual underwriting documentation.  
- Use of Freddie Mac Income Calculator may provide limited representation and warranty relief.
