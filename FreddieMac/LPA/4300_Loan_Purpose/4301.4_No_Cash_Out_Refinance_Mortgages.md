Effective Date: 12/04/2024  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
A **“no cash-out” refinance Mortgage** is one in which the loan proceeds are restricted to specific allowable uses defined below.  
It must also meet all Borrower eligibility requirements in **Section 4301.2**.

---

## (a) Allowable Uses of Proceeds

Proceeds from a “no cash-out” refinance Mortgage **may only be used to:**

1. **Pay off the existing first Mortgage** (principal + interest), including any deferred balance under a loss-mitigation plan, if:  
   - The first Mortgage was used to **acquire the property**, regardless of its age, **or**  
   - The first Mortgage was a refinance loan with a **Note Date ≥ 30 days** before the new refinance Note Date (documented in the Mortgage file via credit report or title commitment).

   > **Note:** For Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages, the amount of Interim Construction Financing secured by the property is treated as payoff of the first Mortgage.

2. **Pay off fees and costs** associated with the satisfaction and release of the first Mortgage (e.g., late fees, prepayment penalties).

3. **Pay off or pay down junior liens** that were **entirely used to acquire** the property.  
   - Any remaining balance must be subordinated.  
   - The Borrower is **not required** to satisfy junior liens meeting requirements in Section 4204.1 (secondary financing) and/or Section 4204.2 (Affordable Seconds®).  
   - If a junior lien is paid off, the Mortgage file must document that **100 % of the lien amount was used for acquisition** of the property.

4. **Pay required share of appreciation** to a subsidy provider under resale-restricted covenants (per Section 4406.8(b)).

5. **Pay related Closing Costs.**  
   - **Past-due or delinquent real estate taxes** cannot be paid with loan proceeds, except when cash out (up to the permitted limit below) is available and used for that purpose.

6. **Provide limited cash to Borrower (or payee)** up to the greater of:  
   - **1 % of the new loan amount**, or  
   - **$2,000 USD**.

7. **Pay off a land contract / contract for deed**, if all requirements in Section 4404.1 are met:  
   - Executed ≥ 12 months before Application Received Date.  
   - 12 months of third-party payment verification required.  
   - LTV based on **current appraised value**.  
   - Executed copy included in Mortgage file.

8. **Pay off a PACE or PACE-like obligation**, subject to Section 4301.8 requirements.

## (c) Treatment of Excess Proceeds
If any funds remain after the allowable uses above:

- The **Mortgage amount must be reduced**, **or**  
- The excess must be **applied as a principal curtailment** at closing and clearly reflected on the Settlement/Closing Disclosure.
