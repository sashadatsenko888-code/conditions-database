## Overview
Freddie Mac will purchase **refinance Mortgages** under the terms of the Purchase Documents, including this chapter.  
A refinance Mortgage is defined as one of the following:

1. A Mortgage where the **proceeds are used to pay off an existing Mortgage or Mortgages** secured by the same property, resulting in the **cancellation of the prior promissory note(s)** and execution of a **new note and Security Instrument**; or  
2. A Mortgage secured by a property **previously owned free and clear** by the Borrower.

## Eligible Refinance Types

| Refinance Category | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **No Cash-Out Refinance** | Proceeds are used to pay off existing debt and related closing costs, without taking cash out to the Borrower. |
| **Freddie Mac Enhanced Relief Refinance®** | Specialized no-cash-out refinance designed for borrowers with high LTVs seeking payment stability. |
| **Refi Possible®** | Streamlined no-cash-out refinance for low- and moderate-income borrowers. |
| **Cash-Out Refinance** | Borrower receives cash back from equity after satisfying the existing Mortgage(s). |
| **Special Purpose Cash-Out Refinance** | Used for debt restructuring or other approved special-purpose transactions under Freddie Mac criteria. |

---

## Construction Conversion and Interim Financing Clarification
A Mortgage whose proceeds are used to **pay off Interim Construction Financing** must comply with **Chapter 4602** requirements for **Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages**.  
This includes adherence to Freddie Mac’s determination criteria for whether the transaction qualifies as a **purchase** or a **refinance** under the Guide.

---

## Compliance Implications
- Sellers must determine the **transaction purpose (purchase vs. refinance)** accurately based on Freddie Mac definitions.  
- All **no cash-out, cash-out, and special-purpose refinances** must meet the applicable underwriting, LTV/TLTV/HTLTV, and delivery conditions in later sections (4302–4304).  
- Loans must satisfy **representations, warranties, and documentation** requirements under the Purchase Documents at the time of delivery.
