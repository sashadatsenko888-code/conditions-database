Section: 4302.4 – Borrower Eligibility (Refi Possible®)  
Effective Date: 12/04/2024  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section outlines the **Borrower eligibility criteria** for Freddie Mac’s **Refi Possible®** program.  
Eligibility focuses on **income thresholds** and **continuity of Borrowers** from the Mortgage being refinanced to ensure sustainable homeownership for low-income households.

---

## (a) Borrower Income Requirements

The Borrower’s **qualifying income**, converted to an **annual basis**, must **not exceed 100% of the Area Median Income (AMI)** for the property location.

### Determining Income Eligibility

| Mortgage Type | Required Method |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Loan Product Advisor® (LPA)** | LPA automatically evaluates income eligibility based on the income entered at submission. |
| **Non-LPA (Manual Underwriting)** | The Seller must determine AMI eligibility using the **Home Possible® Income & Property Eligibility Tool**. |
| **Prohibited Source** | The Seller **may not** use other AMI data sources (e.g., [HUDUser.gov](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/home.html)) to determine eligibility. |

### Key Compliance Notes
- The **income used to qualify the Borrower** must be the same income used to test AMI limits.  
- Sellers must retain in the Mortgage file **income documentation** supporting AMI compliance.  
- Income recalculation or substitution post-qualification is not permitted for the purpose of meeting AMI limits.

## (b) Change in Borrowers

The Borrower(s) **obligated on the Note** for the **Refi Possible® Mortgage** must **generally be the same** as those on the Note for the Mortgage being refinanced.

### Permitted Exceptions
A Borrower obligated on the original Mortgage may be **omitted** from the new Refi Possible® Note **only if** one of the following applies:

| Exception Scenario | Documentation Requirement |
|--------------------|----------------------------|
| **Sole-Payer Continuity** | Evidence in the Mortgage file that the remaining Borrower has made all payments — including secondary financing — for the **most recent 12 months** from **their own funds**. |
| **Borrower Death** | Documentation of the deceased Borrower’s death retained in the Mortgage file. |

> ✅ In all cases, **at least one Borrower** from the Mortgage being refinanced must remain as an **obligated Borrower** on the new Refi Possible® Mortgage.

---

## (c) Compliance and Documentation

- The Seller must maintain:
  - **Income calculation worksheets** or **LPA submission records** verifying AMI compliance.  
  - **Proof of payment continuity** or **death certificate**, if a Borrower is removed.  
- Misrepresentation of AMI eligibility or failure to retain documentation may result in **repurchase or indemnification** per Guide Section 3601.
