## Overview
A **special purpose cash-out refinance Mortgage** is a refinance transaction where the Borrower uses loan proceeds to **buy out the equity of a co-owner** (such as after divorce, partnership dissolution, or co-ownership settlement).  

These Mortgages are considered a subtype of **cash-out refinances**, and must comply with all applicable requirements for cash-out refinance Mortgages â€” **except as explicitly modified** by this section.

---

## Applicable Ratio Requirements
The Mortgage must meet standard LTV/TLTV/HTLTV limits for cash-out refinances as defined in:

- **Section 5703.8(a)** â†’ for Mortgages secured by a **Manufactured Home**  
- **Section 4203.1(b)** â†’ for **all other Mortgages**

---

## (a) Allowable Uses of Proceeds

The **loan amount** in a special purpose cash-out refinance is limited **strictly to funds used for the ownership buy-out**, including:

1. **Payment to the co-owner** being bought out (equity compensation).  
2. **Payoff of existing first Mortgage**, regardless of its age.  
3. **Payoff of junior liens** secured by the Mortgaged Premises.

   > **Note:** Borrowers are *not required* to pay off all junior liens if they meet Freddie Macâ€™s eligibility criteria for:
   > - **Section 4204.1:** Secondary financing  
   > - **Section 4204.2:** Affordable SecondsÂ®  

4. **Payment of related Closing Costs** for the refinance transaction.

ðŸš« **No Borrower cash proceeds** are permitted other than those strictly needed to complete the co-owner buy-out and settlement of secured obligations.

The following Borrower conditions must be satisfied:

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **12-Month Joint Ownership** | Borrower and co-owner must have jointly owned the property **â‰¥ 12 months** before loan application. <br>_Exception: inheritance-based ownership transfers._ |
| **Joint Occupancy** | Both Borrower and co-owner must have **occupied the property as their Primary Residence.** <br>_Exception: inheritance cases._ |
| **Written Agreement** | A **signed agreement** between all parties must state: <br>â€¢ Terms of ownership transfer <br>â€¢ Amount and disposition of refinance proceeds |
| **No Borrower Proceeds** | The Borrower retaining sole ownership **may not receive** any proceeds from the refinance transaction. |

---

## (c) Documentation Requirements

The Seller must retain the following documentation in the Mortgage file:

| Required Document | Purpose |
|--------------------|----------|
| Evidence of joint occupancy | To verify Primary Residence status of Borrower and co-owner. |
| Signed property transfer agreement | To document terms of ownership change and proceeds disposition. |
| Proof of title history | To confirm minimum 12-month joint ownership (unless inherited). |

All documentation must clearly support the transfer of ownership interest and the buy-out transaction purpose.
