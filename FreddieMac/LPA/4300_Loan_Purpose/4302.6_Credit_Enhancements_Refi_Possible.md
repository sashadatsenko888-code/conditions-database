Section: 4302.6 – Credit Enhancements (Refi Possible®)  
Effective Date: 12/04/2024  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section establishes the requirements for **Refi Possible® Mortgages** that refinance existing loans with **recourse**, **indemnification**, or **pool/negotiated credit enhancements**.  
It ensures continuity of Freddie Mac’s credit protection framework when the refinanced loan inherits existing credit risk structures.

---

## (a) Mortgages with Recourse or Indemnification

A Refi Possible® Mortgage that refinances a Mortgage originally sold to Freddie Mac **with recourse or indemnification** is **eligible for delivery** if all the following are true:

1. The **Seller of the Refi Possible® Mortgage is also the Servicer** of the Mortgage being refinanced.  
2. The **new Mortgage is delivered with recourse or indemnification**.  
3. The Mortgage meets the applicable conditions from the following table:

### Requirements When the Mortgage Being Refinanced Has Recourse or Indemnification

| Condition | Requirement for the Refi Possible® Mortgage |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Recourse/Indemnification for Life of Loan** | Must be sold to Freddie Mac **with recourse or indemnification for the life of the new Mortgage**. |
| **Recourse/Indemnification for a Limited Term** | Must be sold to Freddie Mac **with recourse or indemnification matching the remaining term** of the original credit enhancement. |

> ✅ The credit enhancement structure must remain consistent with that of the original Mortgage unless the life or term of the credit protection has expired.

---

## (b) Mortgages with Pool Insurance or Other Negotiated Credit Enhancements

When the Mortgage being refinanced includes **Mortgage Pool Insurance** or another **negotiated credit enhancement**, eligibility depends on the **loan-to-value (LTV)** ratio of the new Refi Possible® Mortgage:

| Scenario | Eligibility Condition |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **LTV ≤ 80%** | Eligible for Refi Possible® delivery, regardless of prior credit enhancement. |
| **LTV > 80%** | Eligible **only if**: <br> – The new Mortgage is delivered with the **same credit enhancement**, and <br> – The **Seller is also the Servicer** of the Mortgage being refinanced. |

---

## (c) Key Compliance Notes

- The **Seller/Servicer relationship must remain unchanged** for recourse, indemnification, or pool-insured Refi Possible® Mortgages.  
- Any change in credit enhancement structure (e.g., removing a life-of-loan recourse feature) renders the loan **ineligible for sale** to Freddie Mac.  
- The **Seller must retain documentation** evidencing both:  
  - The **type and term** of the existing credit enhancement, and  
  - The **continuation of such protection** through the Refi Possible® transaction.  
- Freddie Mac reserves the right to require **delivery with matching credit enhancement** or **repurchase** of the loan if conditions are not met.
