Section: 4302.2 – Acceptable Refinance Practices (Refi Possible®)  
Effective Date: 12/04/2024  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines **advertising, solicitation, and borrower communication standards** applicable to Sellers promoting the **Refi Possible®** refinance offering.  
These standards ensure **equal treatment**, **consumer transparency**, and **non-discriminatory outreach** across Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae portfolios.

---

## (a) Advertising and Solicitation

### Permitted Practices
A Seller **may directly target** Mortgages **owned or securitized by Freddie Mac** for the Refi Possible® program **only if**:
- The **Borrower’s income ≤ 100 %** of the **Area Median Income (AMI)**, **and**
- The Seller **simultaneously applies equivalent advertising and solicitation** to **Borrowers with Fannie Mae–owned or securitized Mortgages**.

### Purpose
This parity requirement ensures that Refi Possible® outreach:
- Is **non-exclusive** to Freddie Mac borrowers, and  
- Complies with **anti-steering** and **fair lending** obligations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Freddie Mac policy.

> ⚠️ A Seller may not market Refi Possible® exclusively to Freddie Mac borrowers unless identical outreach occurs for Fannie Mae borrowers under equivalent eligibility.

---

## (b) Advertising and Other Communications with Borrowers

When a Seller’s outreach references **Freddie Mac by name**, the communication **must include** the following required disclaimer (or substantively identical wording):

> “Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have adopted a new refinance option for Mortgages to Borrowers with incomes at or below 100% of the Area Median Income.  
> If your Mortgage is owned or guaranteed by either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, you may be eligible to refinance your Mortgage under one of these refinance options.  
> You can determine whether your Mortgage is owned by Freddie Mac by checking Freddie Mac’s website at [https://loanlookup.freddiemac.com/](https://loanlookup.freddiemac.com/).”

### Requirements
- Disclosure language must be **clearly visible** and **unambiguous**.  
- References to eligibility must **not imply Freddie Mac endorsement or preference**.  
- The URL to Freddie Mac’s **Loan Look-Up Tool** must be included or hyperlinked when possible.  

---

## (c) Compliance Notes
- The Seller’s outreach materials (print, digital, or telephonic) must comply with **consumer protection and advertising truth-in-lending standards**.  
- Freddie Mac reserves the right to audit communications for **compliance parity** and **accuracy** of borrower eligibility representations.  
- All marketing templates should be reviewed by **compliance counsel or marketing governance** prior to distribution.
