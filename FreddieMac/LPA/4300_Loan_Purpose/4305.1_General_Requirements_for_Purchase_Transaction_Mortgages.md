## (a) Purchase Transaction Definition

A **purchase transaction Mortgage** is a Mortgage in which the loan proceeds are used to:

1. **Acquire the Mortgaged Premises**, or  
2. **Acquire and finance improvements** to the property as permitted under the Seller’s Purchase Documents, or  
3. **Pay off Interim Construction Financing**, per Chapter 4602 (Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages), or  
4. **Pay off the outstanding balance under a land contract or contract for deed**, in compliance with Chapter 4404.

## (b) Cash Back or Principal Curtailment

### (i) Permissible Cash Back or Curtailment  
Cash back to the Borrower, or a principal curtailment, is **permitted only** when it results from reimbursement or overpayment of costs, fees, or charges related to the transaction.

**Examples include:**
- Earnest money deposit exceeding required down payment  
- Fees paid at application later covered by a financing concession (see Section 5501.6(b))  
- Reduction of closing costs after closing  
- Gift funds exceeding the amount needed for closing  
- Seller reimbursement of real estate taxes paid in arrears (covering pre-Note Date period)  
- Refunds required by federal law or regulation  

---

### (ii) Required Documentation  
All cash back or principal curtailments must be:

- **Reflected on the Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement**, and  
- Supported by documentation in the Mortgage file showing the **amount** and **reason** for the reimbursement or refund.

---

### (iii) Minimum Borrower Contribution  
If the Borrower must meet a **minimum contribution requirement**, it must be satisfied **at closing**, even if the Borrower later receives cash back.

Relevant sections:
- **Section 5501.3(k):** Second homes, investment properties, and shared equity plans  
- **Section 4501.7:** Home Possible® Mortgages  
- **Section 4504.7(a):** HeritageOne® Mortgages  

If projected cash back causes the Borrower to **fall below** the minimum contribution threshold, the excess must be **applied as a principal curtailment**.
