## Overview
A **Texas Equity Section 50(a)(6) Mortgage** is a refinance of a Borrower‚Äôs **Texas homestead** originated under **Article XVI, Section 50(a)(6)** of the Texas Constitution.  
These transactions are highly regulated ‚ÄúTexas cash-out‚Äù loans and are **not identical** to Freddie Mac‚Äôs standard cash-out or ‚Äúno cash-out‚Äù refinances described elsewhere in Chapter 4301.

Sellers are responsible for understanding:
- When a refinance of a Texas homestead **must** be originated under Section 50(a)(6); and  
- The constitutional restrictions that supersede standard Freddie Mac definitions.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- Freddie Mac‚Äôs terms ‚Äúcash-out‚Äù / ‚Äúno cash-out‚Äù refinance **do not necessarily match** the Texas constitutional definitions.  
- The Seller must determine whether a transaction on a Texas homestead **is subject to Section 50(a)(6)**, regardless of Freddie Mac terminology.  
- Sellers are responsible for full legal compliance with **Texas Constitution Art. XVI ¬ß 50(a)(6)** and related regulations.

---

## (b) Eligible Mortgages
A Texas Equity Section 50(a)(6) Mortgage must be:
- A **conventional First Lien** Mortgage that is either:  
  - Fixed-rate, or  
  - A 3/6-, 5/6-, 7/6-, or 10/6-Month ARM.  
- Categorized as a **cash-out** or **‚Äúno cash-out‚Äù** refinance under Freddie Mac rules, depending on facts of the transaction.  
- **Not** a Special Purpose Cash-Out Refinance (Section 4301.6).

---

## (c) Refinancing Existing Texas Equity Loans
Sellers may refinance:
1. A Texas Equity ¬ß 50(a)(6) Mortgage into another ¬ß 50(a)(6) Mortgage; or  
2. Into a **¬ß 50(a)(4) Mortgage** permitted under Article XVI ¬ß 50(a)(4).

> **Note:** A ¬ß 50(a)(4) refinance that meets all constitutional requirements is treated as a **‚Äúno cash-out‚Äù refinance** under Section 4301.4.

---

## (d) Property and Appraisal Requirements
Each Mortgage must be secured by:
- A **1-unit Primary Residence**, located in **Texas**, and designated as the Borrower‚Äôs **homestead**.

### Appraisal and Fair Market Value Acknowledgment
- Appraisal must comply with **Freddie Mac standards** and **Texas Const. ¬ß 50(a)(6)(Q)(ix)** and ¬ß 50(h).  
- The Seller and Borrower must execute a **written acknowledgment of fair market value**, dated as of the loan‚Äôs closing date, with the appraisal attached.

---

## (e) LTV / TLTV Limits
- **Maximum LTV/TLTV = 80 %**, or lower if required under Sections 4203.1(b) or 4301.4.  
- No exceptions permitted under Texas law.  
- If a HELOC is present, combined HTLTV must also ‚â§ 80 %.
