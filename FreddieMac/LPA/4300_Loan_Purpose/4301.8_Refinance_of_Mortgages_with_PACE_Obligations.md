Section: 4301.8 – Refinance of Mortgages Secured by Properties Subject to an Energy Retrofit Loan  
Effective Date: 09/04/2024  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section governs refinance eligibility and documentation requirements for **Mortgages secured by properties with Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE)** or **PACE-like obligations**.

A **PACE obligation** is defined as any **energy retrofit loan** that:
- Finances **energy efficiency improvements**, and  
- Is **repaid through a property tax assessment**.

PACE obligations are frequently structured to create a **First Lien priority**, which may impact refinance eligibility and lien enforceability.  

---

## (a) “No Cash-Out” Refinance — PACE Obligations Paid Off
When refinancing a property with a **First Lien PACE obligation**, the following requirements must all be met if the new refinance is **“no cash-out”**:

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Mortgage Type** | The new refinance must meet all requirements of **Section 4301.4** (“No Cash-Out” Refinance Mortgages). |
| **Ownership** | The Mortgage being refinanced must be **owned, securitized, or guaranteed** (in whole or in part) by **Freddie Mac**. |
| **Full PACE Payoff** | The **PACE obligation must be fully paid off** using proceeds from the new refinance. Partial payoffs are not permitted. |
| **Lien Priority Verification** | The Mortgage file must include **evidence that the obligation being paid off is a First Lien or First-Lien–priority PACE obligation**. |
| **ULDD Delivery Requirement** | Seller must deliver **Investor Feature Identifier (IFI) “H61”** when delivering a Freddie Mac–owned “no cash-out” refinance Mortgage used to pay a PACE obligation. <br>_See Section 6302.16(b)(ii) for technical delivery guidance._ |

---

## (b) Cash-Out Refinance — PACE Obligations Paid Off
When performing a **cash-out refinance** secured by a property with a PACE obligation, the following apply:

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Mortgage Type** | The new refinance must meet all requirements of **Section 4301.5** (Cash-Out Refinance Mortgages). |
| **Full Payoff (If First Lien)** | If the PACE obligation **results in or provides for First Lien priority**, it must be **fully paid off** with refinance proceeds. |
| **Green Mortgage Eligibility** | Mortgages secured by **energy-efficient properties** with PACE obligations may also qualify under **Chapter 4606 (GreenCHOICE Mortgages®)**, if all additional program criteria are met. |

---

## (c) Delivery Coding Summary
| Scenario | IFI Code | Applicable Guide Section |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| “No Cash-Out” Refinance used to pay off a PACE obligation | **H61** | 6302.16(b)(ii) |
| Cash-Out Refinance paying off PACE obligation | Not required (standard cash-out delivery) | 4301.5 |

---

## (d) Documentation Requirements
The Mortgage file must include:
- Documentation identifying the lien as a **PACE obligation** or **PACE-like energy retrofit loan**.  
- Evidence confirming **lien priority status** (i.e., First Lien vs. subordinate lien).  
- Proof of **full payoff** of the PACE obligation at closing.  
- **Settlement/Closing Disclosure** reflecting payoff from refinance proceeds.  

---

## (e) Key Compliance Notes
- Freddie Mac will **not purchase** any Mortgage where the PACE lien remains in First Lien position after refinance.  
- The PACE assessment **must be extinguished** or **subordinated** to ensure Freddie Mac holds an enforceable First Lien.  
- Sellers must verify that payoff statements and tax assessment releases reflect **zero balance and release** of PACE lien rights.
