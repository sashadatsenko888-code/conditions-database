Effective Date: 11/06/2024  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
A **cash-out refinance Mortgage** is a refinance transaction **without specific restrictions** on the use of loan proceeds.  
It allows the Borrower to extract equity from the property, subject to Freddie Mac’s ownership, occupancy, and documentation requirements.

---

## (a) Occupancy Requirement for Primary Residences
For **Primary Residence** cash-out refinances:  
> **All Borrowers must occupy the Mortgaged Premises.**

- This requirement ensures the loan is not used for investment or speculative purposes under the guise of a Primary Residence refinance.

---

## (b) Six-Month Ownership Requirement for the Mortgaged Premises
At least **one Borrower must have held title** to the Mortgaged Premises for **six months or more** prior to the Note Date.  
This ownership duration rule applies across all property types, with the following specifications:

| Property Type | Requirement |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Fee Simple** | At least one Borrower must have been on title for ≥ 6 months. |
| **Leasehold Estate** | Borrower must have been lessee under the ground lease for ≥ 6 months. |
| **Cooperative Unit** | Borrower must have held Cooperative Shares tied to the unit for ≥ 6 months. |
| **LLC or LP Ownership** | Time held in entity’s name counts **if** Borrower has been a **majority owner or controlling member** since acquisition and **title is transferred to Borrower personally on or before Note Date**. |

> **Note:**  
> Special Purpose Cash-Out Refinance Mortgages must comply with Section **4301.6** ownership requirements.

### Exceptions to Six-Month Ownership Rule

| Scenario | Requirements |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Inheritance / Legal Award** | At least one Borrower inherited or was legally awarded the property (e.g., divorce, dissolution, or separation). |
| **Delayed Financing** | Borrower purchased property with cash and is now refinancing to recoup funds. The following must be met: |
|  | - Purchase Settlement/Closing Disclosure (or equivalent) shows **no financing secured by the property** was used. |
|  | - Preliminary title shows Borrower as owner **with no liens**. |
|  | - Source of purchase funds is **fully documented**. |
|  | - If borrowed funds were used: cash-out proceeds must **first repay those borrowed funds**, with any remaining balance treated as standard cash-out. |
|  | - Any remaining loan payments must be included in the **debt-to-income ratio** (see Section 5401.2). |
|  | - The new loan amount may not exceed **purchase price + closing costs – gift funds** used. |
|  | - There must be **no affiliation or relationship** between buyer and seller in the purchase transaction. |

## (c) Cash-Out Refinance Paying Off a First Lien Mortgage
When cash-out proceeds are used to **pay off an existing First Lien Mortgage**, all of the following apply:

1. The cash-out refinance must meet **Borrower requirements in Section 4301.2**.  
2. The **refinanced First Lien** must be **seasoned at least 12 months**, as documented (credit report or title commitment).  
3. **Exceptions to seasoning** (12-month rule does **not** apply) include:  
   - **Special Purpose Cash-Out Refinance** meeting Section 4301.6.  
   - The First Lien being refinanced is a **HELOC**.  
   - The new loan is a **Construction Conversion or Renovation Mortgage**.  
   - The refinance is to **convert a Manufactured Home to real property** under State law.

## (d) Cash-Out Refinance on Property Owned Free and Clear
If the property was **previously owned free and clear**, any new Mortgage placed on it is considered a **cash-out refinance Mortgage**.

### Exceptions:
| Program | Condition for Exception |
