## Overview
When an **existing Mortgage** will be **satisfied through a refinance transaction**, at least one of the following borrower eligibility requirements must be met.  
These rules determine who can be an eligible Borrower on the new refinance Mortgage.

## Borrower Eligibility Criteria

| # | Requirement | Description |
|---|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Continuity of Obligation** | At least one Borrower on the refinance Mortgage must also have been a Borrower on the Mortgage being refinanced. |
| 2 | **Title and Occupancy History** | At least one Borrower must have held title to and **resided in the property as a Primary Residence for the most recent 12 months**, and the Mortgage file must include proof of **timely Mortgage and secondary-financing payments** for that period. |
| 3 | **Inheritance or Legal Award** | At least one Borrower must have **inherited or been legally awarded** the property (e.g., through divorce, separation, or dissolution of a domestic partnership). |

---

## Living Trust Note
If the Borrower is a **Living Trust** that has become **irrevocable** due to a Settlor’s death, it may still be eligible **only if** it continues to meet Freddie Mac’s **revocability and other applicable Living Trust eligibility requirements** at the time of refinance.

---

## Compliance and Documentation Requirements
- The Mortgage file must document the Borrower’s ownership and payment history (e.g., deed records, payment verification for 12 months, divorce decrees, probate records as applicable).   
- Sellers must verify continuity of obligation or document the inheritance/legal transfer event.   
- Living Trust eligibility must be validated per Guide trust requirements (see Series A1 and Chapter 5103).
