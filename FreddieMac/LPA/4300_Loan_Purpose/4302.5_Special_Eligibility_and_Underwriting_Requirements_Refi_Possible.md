Effective Date: 08/06/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section specifies the **special eligibility, underwriting, and documentation requirements** applicable to Freddie Mac’s **Refi Possible® Mortgages**, for both **Loan Product Advisor® (LPA)** and **Manually Underwritten** loans.

Refi Possible® aims to expand refinance access to **low-income Borrowers** by providing **flexible documentation**, **reduced credit overlays**, and **favorable DTI thresholds**, while maintaining Freddie Mac’s credit risk and collateral standards.

---

## (a) Underwriting Path

A Refi Possible® Mortgage must be either:

1. **Submitted to Loan Product Advisor® (LPA)** per Chapter 5101, or  
2. **Manually underwritten** in accordance with all applicable Guide provisions unless otherwise modified in this section.

> The Mortgage must be otherwise eligible for **manual underwriting** under Freddie Mac’s Guide standards.

---

## (c) Secondary Financing

Existing subordinate liens are allowed **only if** they meet all of the following:

- Existing junior lien **must be subordinated** to the Refi Possible® Mortgage, and comply with **Chapter 4204** secondary financing requirements.  
- May be **refinanced simultaneously**, provided:
  - The **new junior lien UPB ≤** the UPB of the lien being refinanced, and
