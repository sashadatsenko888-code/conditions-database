Section: 8103.1 – Servicer Fiscal Responsibilities  
Effective Date: 07/09/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section – Include in Ruleset if fiscal compliance impacts eligibility**

## ## Overview
Section 8103.1 explains the Servicer’s **financial statement requirements** and clarifies Freddie Mac’s definition of **Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)** versus **Servicing Contract Rights**.

---

## ## (a) Balance Sheet and Financial Statements
The Servicer must:

- Prepare its balance sheet and all other financial statements so they **clearly reflect the sale of Mortgages to Freddie Mac as a sale of assets**.  
- Comply with all additional file-identification and accounting-record requirements found elsewhere in the Guide.

---

## ## (b) Mortgage Servicing Rights
Freddie Mac clarifies the following:

### **1. Terminology**
Although the mortgage industry frequently uses the terms **“mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)”**, these terms are simply **shorthand**.  
Freddie Mac uses the precise term **Servicing Contract Rights**, and all Purchase Documents rely on that definition.

### **2. Nature of Rights**
The terms “MSR” and “Mortgage Servicing Rights”:

- Are **not ownership interests** in Servicing.  
- Exist **only for convenience** due to accounting practice (e.g., GAAP).  
- Refer to **Servicing Contract Rights**, which are:
  1. **Conditional** — Freddie Mac may terminate them in whole or in part at Freddie Mac’s discretion.  
  2. **Not owned by the Servicer** — the Servicer only holds rights sufficient to satisfy UCC § 9-203(b)(2).
