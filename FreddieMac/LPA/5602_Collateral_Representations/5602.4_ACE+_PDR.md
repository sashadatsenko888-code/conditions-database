Section: 5602.4 – ACE+ PDR  
Effective Date: 06/04/2025  

---

This section outlines Freddie Mac’s requirements for **ACE+ PDR (Property Data Report)** — an enhanced collateral evaluation option available through **Loan Product Advisor® (LPA)**.

---

## (a) ACE+ PDR overview
For certain LPA Mortgages, the Seller may receive the **option to accept ACE+ PDR** and originate the Mortgage with a **Property Data Report (PDR)** instead of a traditional appraisal.

When the Seller accepts the ACE+ PDR offer:
- Freddie Mac will accept as the property value:
  - The **purchase price** (for purchase transactions), or
  - The **estimated value** (for refinance transactions);
- Freddie Mac will **not exercise remedies** (e.g., repurchase requests) for breaches of representations and warranties related to property value.

For refinance transactions, Sellers must maintain **written procedures** prohibiting value manipulation to obtain ACE+ PDR or better loan terms.  
These procedures must define the process for establishing estimated value (e.g., borrower estimate, AVM, online valuation tool).

---

## (b) Process for qualifying for and accepting the ACE+ PDR offer
To qualify:
1. The Mortgage must be an **Accept Mortgage**;  
2. The **Last Feedback Certificate** must indicate eligibility for **ACE or ACE+ PDR** (the “offer”);  
3. The **final submission** to Loan Selling Advisor® must indicate representation and warranty relief status as “Y” or “Yes.”  

Sellers may instead deliver an **appraisal report** if eligibility for that appraisal type is met.  
When accepting ACE+ PDR, the Seller must deliver all **ULDD Data Points** required under Section 6302.10(c).

---

## (c) Eligible Mortgages
A Mortgage is eligible for ACE+ PDR if:
- It is secured by a **1-unit dwelling** that is a **Primary Residence** or **Second Home**;  
- It meets the following **LTV/TLTV** thresholds:

| Mortgage Purpose | Occupancy | Maximum LTV/TLTV |
|------------------|------------|------------------|
| Purchase | Primary Residence or Second Home | Program limits* |
| “No cash-out” refinance | Primary Residence or Second Home | 90% |
| Cash-out refinance | Primary Residence | 70% |
| Cash-out refinance | Second Home | 60% |

\*Up to program limits for the specific Mortgage product.

## (e) Conditions that prevent Seller acceptance
A Seller may **not accept** the ACE+ PDR offer if:
- An **appraisal is required by law or regulation**, or  
- **Rental income from an ADU** is used to qualify the Borrower.

---

## (f) Acceptable age of the ACE+ PDR offer
