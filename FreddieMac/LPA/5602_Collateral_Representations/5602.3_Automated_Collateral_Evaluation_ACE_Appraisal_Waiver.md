Section: 5602.3 – Automated Collateral Evaluation (ACE) – Appraisal Waiver  
Effective Date: 02/24/2025  

---

This section outlines Freddie Mac’s requirements for **Automated Collateral Evaluation (ACE)** — an appraisal waiver option available through **Loan Product Advisor®**.

---

## (a) ACE overview
For certain Loan Product Advisor Mortgages, the Seller may receive an **option to accept an appraisal waiver** and originate the Mortgage **without an appraisal**.

When the Seller accepts the ACE offer:
- Freddie Mac will **accept** the property value as:  
  - The **purchase price** (for purchase transactions), or  
  - The **estimated value** (for refinance transactions).  
- Freddie Mac will **not exercise remedies** (including repurchase) for breaches of value, condition, or marketability representations and warranties.  

For refinance transactions, Sellers must maintain **written procedures** prohibiting manipulation of the estimated value to obtain an appraisal waiver or more favorable loan terms.  
These procedures must define how estimated value is established (e.g., Borrower’s estimate, AVM, online valuation tools).

---

## (b) Process for qualifying for and accepting the appraisal waiver offer
To qualify:
1. The Mortgage must be an **Accept Mortgage**.  
2. The **Last Feedback Certificate** must indicate the loan is eligible for **representation and warranty relief with an appraisal waiver** (the “offer”).  
3. The final submission to **Loan Selling Advisor®** must reflect a relief status of “Y” or “Yes.”  
4. In lieu of the waiver, the Seller may deliver the Mortgage with a **PDR** or **appraisal**, if ACE+ PDR or standard appraisal eligibility is met.

When accepting the waiver, the Seller must deliver all applicable **ULDD Data Points** (see Section 6302.10(c)).

---

## (c) Eligible Mortgages
To be eligible, the Mortgage must:
- Be secured by a **1-unit dwelling** (Primary Residence or second home).  
- Meet the following LTV/TLTV ratio limits:

| Mortgage Purpose | Occupancy Type | Max LTV/TLTV |
|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Purchase | Primary Residence or Second Home | 90% |
| “No cash-out” refinance | Primary Residence or Second Home | 90% |
| Cash-out refinance | Primary Residence | 70% |
| Cash-out refinance | Second Home | 60% |

---

## (d) Ineligible Mortgages
The following are **ineligible** for ACE appraisal waivers:
- Loans with an **appraisal or PDR already obtained**.  
- Mortgages secured by:
  - **Manufactured Homes**  
  - **Leasehold estates**
  - **Properties with resale restrictions** (except age-based)
- **Non-arm’s-length transactions**
- **Properties sold by lenders or government entities**
- Loans with **estimated value or price > $1,000,000**
- **CHOICERenovation®**, **Community Land Trust**, **Construction Conversion**, **GreenCHOICE®**, **Renovation**, **Cooperative Share Loans**, **Enhanced Relief Refinance®**, or **Seller-Owned Modified Home Possible®** Mortgages.
- **Texas Equity Section 50(a)(6)** and **50(f)(2)** Mortgages.

---

## (e) Conditions that prevent acceptance of the appraisal waiver
A Seller **may not accept** the appraisal waiver if:
- An **appraisal is legally required**;  
- **Rental income from an ADU** is used to qualify the Borrower; or  
- The Seller is aware of **adverse property conditions**, such as:
  - **Contamination** or **hazardous materials**;
  - **Structural or safety defects**.  

Minor cosmetic issues (e.g., cracked window, missing trim) do **not** disqualify the waiver if property eligibility is maintained.  
Major issues (e.g., active roof leaks, failing foundation) **require** a PDR or appraisal.

---

## (f) Acceptable age of appraisal waiver offer
- The appraisal waiver offer is valid for **120 days** from the date of the Loan Product Advisor Feedback Certificate.  
- If more than 120 days old on the **Note Date**, resubmission is required to confirm eligibility.

---

## (g) Data changes that impact waiver eligibility
Any change to critical loan data (e.g., address, price, value, loan amount, occupancy, property type, or loan type) **invalidates the original waiver offer** and triggers a new eligibility assessment.

---

## (h) Settlement Dates beyond 120 days from Note Date
For Settlement Dates more than 120 days after the Note Date, the Seller must **warrant** that the property’s value as of the Settlement Date is **no less than** the estimated value or purchase price submitted to Loan Product Advisor.

---

## (i) Appraisal waiver eligibility in disaster areas
Sellers may accept ACE waivers in **disaster areas** if they can **represent and warrant** that:
- The **value and marketability** of the Mortgaged Premises **have not been adversely affected**.  
(See Section 4407.1 for property condition requirements.)

---

## (j) Seller representation limitations
When an appraisal waiver is accepted, the Seller **must not represent** that Freddie Mac performed a **property review** or obtained a **valuation** of the Mortgaged Premises.
