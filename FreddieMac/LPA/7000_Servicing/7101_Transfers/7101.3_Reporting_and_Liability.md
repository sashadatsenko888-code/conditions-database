Section: 7101.3 – Transfers of Servicing, Reporting Requirements and Liabilities of the Transferor and Transferee Servicers  
Effective Date: 09/10/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines how **loan-level reporting, accounting reporting, and liabilities** are allocated between the **Transferor Servicer** and the **Transferee Servicer** during and after a **Transfer of Servicing (ToS)**.  
It also establishes indemnification obligations and clarifies each Servicer’s continuing responsibilities to Freddie Mac.

---

## (a) Loan-Level Reporting

**Transferor Servicer**
- Must report **all loan-level transactions** (including payoffs and revisions) for the **Accounting Cycle prior** to the Effective Date of Transfer.  
  - Example: For a transfer effective **Feb 1**, all transactions through **Jan 31** must be submitted before close of business Jan 31, with edits cleared no later than **Jan 31 + 1 business day**.

**Transferee Servicer**
- Beginning **on the Effective Date**, must submit all subsequent loan-level reports in its own **Seller/Servicer name and number**.

---

## (b) Accounting Reporting and Drafting

### Transferor Servicer — Must report and will be drafted for:
- **Payoffs** dated **before** Effective Date of Transfer.  
- **Third-party foreclosure sales** with sale date **before** Effective Date.  
- **Forecasted scheduled interest** reported in the **month before** the Effective Date but due during the transfer month.  
- **Principal** reported during the accounting cycle immediately preceding the transfer.

### Transferee Servicer — Must report and will be drafted for:
- **Payoffs** dated **on or after** Effective Date.  
- **Foreclosure sales** occurring **on or after** Effective Date.  
- **Principal and interest** reported **on or after** Effective Date.  

All reporting must follow Section **8303.1(c)** requirements.

---

## (c) General Rules for Allocation of Liabilities

### (i) Transferee Servicer Assumption
- By executing **Form 960** (Concurrent Transfer) or **STOS Agreement** (Subsequent Transfer), the Transferee Servicer **assumes liability** for **all Seller and prior Servicer** obligations, covenants, warranties, and liabilities related to transferred Mortgages — even if the Transferor did not originally bear that liability.

### (ii) Joint and Several Liability
- The assumption **does not release** the Transferor, prior Servicers, or original Seller.  
- All parties share **joint and several liability** for duties and obligations tied to transferred Mortgages and REO.

### (iii) Transferor Not Liable for Later Servicing Violations
- Transferor is **not liable** for **post-transfer Servicing violations** caused solely and directly by actions/omissions of later Transferees.

---

## (d) Special Rules for Allocation of Liabilities

### (i) Bifurcated Servicing-Released Programs (Cash-Released XChange®, Co-Issue XChange®)
- **Seller** remains **solely liable** for all **sale representations and warranties**.  
- **Transferee Servicer** is liable for all **Servicing obligations** under Purchase Documents.

For subsequent Transfers:
- Original Seller Transferor remains liable for **sale representations**, unless Freddie Mac approves a new assumption.  
- The new Transferee Servicer assumes **Servicing obligations**, while prior Servicers retain **joint and several liability**.  
- Transferor is **not liable** for future Servicing violations by later Transferees.

### (ii) Correspondent XChange® (Operational Bifurcation)
- **Originator** (as in Exhibit 29) is liable for **Origination and Sale Obligations**.  
- If Originator is suspended or terminated, the **Seller to Freddie Mac** assumes those obligations.  
- **Transferee Servicer (Seller)** is liable for **Servicing Obligations** under Purchase Documents.  

For **Subsequent Transfers**:
- Originator remains liable for **Origination and Sale Obligations**.  
- New Transferee Servicer assumes **Servicing Obligations** for transferred Mortgages.

---

## (e) Hold Freddie Mac Harmless
Both Servicers, **jointly and severally**, must **indemnify and hold Freddie Mac harmless** against all losses, claims, damages, or expenses (including attorney fees) resulting from:
- Failure to comply with laws or Freddie Mac Servicing requirements.  
- Failure to provide borrower **notices** required by Section 7101.7(b).  
- Failure to make required **Escrow disbursements**.  
- Failure to **credit borrower payments** properly.

---

## (f) Transferee Servicer Responsibilities to Service Mortgages
By signing **Form 960**, **STOS Agreement**, or **Exhibit 26 (Co-Issue XChange Agreement)**, the Transferee Servicer:
- Agrees to service all Mortgages listed in the **Final Mortgage List** (as defined in Section 7101.1(b)(ii)(A)).  
- Assumes all **Servicing Contract obligations** of the Transferor for those Mortgages.  
- Must perform in full compliance with Freddie Mac’s Servicing Contract requirements.
