Section: 7101.1 – Requests for Transfers of Servicing and Intra-Servicer Portfolio Moves  
Effective Date: 11/03/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section sets requirements for **Transfers of Servicing (ToS)** and **Intra-Servicer Portfolio Moves**, including approval, data exchange, timelines, electronic signatures, and Freddie Mac’s enforcement rights. It covers **Concurrent Transfers** at sale and **Subsequent Transfers** of existing portfolios.

---

## (a) Transfer of Servicing Overview
A ToS requires **Freddie Mac’s prior written approval**, whether resulting from:
- A negotiated transfer between **Transferor** and **Transferee** Servicers, or
- Organizational/ownership changes that effectively transfer **Servicing Contract Rights**.

Servicers should use Freddie Mac’s **Servicing Transfer Management Checklist** and MISMO resources. See also 8105.1(b) (compensation when initiated by Freddie), and 1402.13 for **eMortgage** transfers.

---

## (b) Submitting Requests for Transfers and Intra-Servicer Moves
- **Approval required** before any transfer (including those initiated by conservators/receivers/liquidators).
- If Transferee will use a **new Servicing Agent**, comply with Ch. 8101 and submit **Form 479A**.

**Purchase Documents Sharing (on/before Effective Date of Transfer):**
- Transferor provides Transferee copies of its **Purchase Documents** and those of any **prior Transferor**, excluding Credit Fees.

### (i) Concurrent Transfers of Servicing (CTOS)
Prior approval is required before designating a Transferee at sale. Transferor must provide pre-transfer data by loan number, including:
- Lender-purchased MI terms; any credit enhancement
- Affordable housing origination; **Manufactured Home**
- Negotiated term restricting ToS; **Payoff Draft Date 18**
- **eNote/eModification** repository info
- Any unique servicing requirements

Freddie provides funding detail reports to aid Servicing setup.

**(A) CTOS without bifurcation**  
- Execute **Form 960** (one per Transferee). Approval effective upon Freddie’s execution; remains until expiration/termination.  
- In Loan Selling Advisor®: select **CTOS** path and the Transferee’s Seller/Servicer number.

**(B) CTOS with full bifurcation — Cash-Released XChange®**  
- Governed by **Exhibit 28A**; select **Servicing Released** execution path; Transferee provides Seller/Servicer number.

**(C) CTOS with full bifurcation — Co-Issue XChange®**  
- Governed by **Exhibit 26**; select **CTOS** path; Transferee provides Seller/Servicer number; model bilateral agreement **Exhibit 27**.

### (ii) Subsequent Transfers of Servicing (STOS)
**Timing:** Submit request **45–60 days** before requested Effective Date of Transfer (must be **first day of a month**) via **Servicing Transfer Manager (STM)** in Freddie Mac Gateway.

**Process:**
- Transferor: Create STOS, complete required fields, select Transferee, upload **Proposed Mortgage List**.  
- Transferee: Complete its fields in STM.  
- Freddie: Adds data; Transferor validates accuracy and completeness.  
- Both Servicers e-sign **STOS Agreement** in STM **45–60 days** before Effective Date.  
- Transferor may add/remove loans up to **8 days** before the Effective Date; if changed, both must re-execute STOS Agreement on the **Final Mortgage List**.

**Exclusions (not transferable as of day prior to Effective Date):**
- Paid-off loans  
- FHA/VA loans with scheduled foreclosure sale date  
- Loans **90+ days delinquent**  
- Previously **modified** loans  
(Transfer via **Voluntary Partial Cancellation** under Ch. 7102 if needed.)

**Costs/Claims Events (1101.3):**  
Certain STOS actions may trigger **FRE Claims** becoming due; Transferor must **pay** or obtain a **waiver** to secure approval.

**Approval & Execution:**  
- Freddie may withdraw approval before Effective Date for list changes or eligibility issues.  
- Upon approval, Freddie e-signs STOS in STM.

**Data Package (before e-signature):** Transferor must deliver granular loan-level data, including whether each loan:  
- Has lender-purchased MI (terms) or other credit enhancement  
- Is under trial plan/modification (program type), or **Payment Deferral**  
- Is or may become **Senior Subordinate** (see Ch. 8601)  
- Has step-rate, actual/actual remitting, partial forbearance, affordable housing origination, **Manufactured Home**, negotiated ToS restriction, payment cap/option ARM/biweekly, specific remittance option (e.g., Payoff Draft Date 18), **repurchase/remedy demand** status, and any **eNote/eModification/Electronic Payment Deferral** repository info

**Transferee Due Diligence:**  
- Must confirm receipt of all relevant data and its **operational capacity** to service each loan.

**Electronic Signatures:**  
- STOS e-signature flow in STM constitutes an **Eligible Electronic Transaction**; the executed STOS Agreement is a **Purchase Document**.  
- Both Servicers must **download and retain** the fully executed STOS and Final Mortgage List.

### (iii) Denied Requests
Freddie can **deny** a ToS request and is **not obligated** to provide reasons.

### (iv) Freddie Mac’s Rights
**(A) Unauthorized Servicing Transfer:**  
- Grounds for **suspension/disqualification** of both parties; constitutes a **Claims Event** (all FRE Claims immediately due).  
- Compensatory fee up to **1% of Freddie’s UPB share** of affected loans; joint and several liability for losses/costs (including attorney fees).  
- Does not limit other remedies.

**(B) Post-Transfer Reviews:**  
- Freddie may conduct post-transfer reviews (including onsite), or require Servicer to do so and provide documentation.

### (v) Intra-Servicer Portfolio Move
For Servicers with multiple Seller/Servicer numbers:
- Submit **Intra-Servicer Portfolio Move Request** via STM **30–60 days** before effective date; include loan list; e-sign acknowledgment.  
- Upon approval, Freddie updates systems; Servicer must update its systems and inform **Document Custodian**.  
- Ensure P&I and escrow payments are deposited in the **Custodial Account** associated with the **new** Seller/Servicer number (see 8302.1(a)).  
- Rights/obligations under Purchase Documents **do not change**.
