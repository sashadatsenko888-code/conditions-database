Section: 7101.4 – Endorsement of Notes, Assignment of Security Instruments, Transfer of Records & Document Custody (Transfers of Servicing)  
Effective Date: 09/10/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Defines what must happen to **Notes, Security Instruments, assignments, records, and custody** when Servicing is transferred. Covers **MERS vs. non-MERS**, **Manufactured Homes in certificate-of-title States**, and **custody workflows** for **Concurrent** and **Subsequent** Transfers (including transfers without custody movement and custody-only transfers).

Key premise:
- Notes for Mortgages sold to Freddie Mac are **endorsed in blank** per §6301.3. During a Transfer of Servicing, the **Transferor Servicer prepares/records Security Instrument assignments** but **must not complete/further endorse** the blank Note.  
- **LNAs are not live Notes** and **cannot be endorsed**.

---

## (a) Endorsement & Assignment Requirements

### (i) Concurrent Transfers — **Not registered with MERS**
Transferor Servicer must:
- Record **Intervening Assignments** to complete the chain from original mortgagee to itself (§6301.6(a)).  
- **Assign** the Security Instrument to the **Transferee Servicer** and **record** the assignment.  
- Follow §7101.4(c) delivery steps; deliver the assignment to the **Transferee Servicer’s Document Custodian** for verification per §6304.2.

### (ii) Concurrent or Subsequent Transfers — **Registered with MERS**
- If **Transferee is a MERS Member**: **no new assignment**; Transferor must **notify MERS** of the Transfer.  
- If **Transferee is not a MERS Member**: Transferor prepares/records an **assignment from MERS to Transferee Servicer**.  
- Deliver to Transferee Document Custodian for verification/certification per §6304.2. See §6301.6(b) for details.

### (iii) Subsequent Transfers — **Not registered with MERS**
Transferor Servicer must:
- **Recover and destroy** any **original unrecorded assignment to Freddie Mac**.  
- **Assign** the Security Instrument to Transferee and **record** it.  
- Follow §7101.4(c) delivery to the **Transferee Document Custodian** per §6304.2.  
- If the **most recent recorded assignment is to Freddie Mac**, the Transferor **may not** prepare an assignment to the Transferee.

---

## (b) Manufactured Homes — Certificate-of-Title States (no title surrender/cancelation)
In addition to Security Instrument assignments on land:
- If **Borrower holds the original title**, obtain it and **note assignments on the title** as required; return per procedure after copying.  
- **Note all intervening assignments** on the title; record chain with the State motor vehicle/authorized agency if required.  
- **Note/record** Assignment **to Transferee** on the title/with agency if required.  
- **Deliver** the title (or copy) showing **complete chain** to the Transferee Servicer; Transferee must **retain** in the Mortgage file. See §5703.4(f)(iii).

---

## (c) Document Custody Requirements

### (i) **Concurrent** Transfers of Servicing
- **Seller** submits **Form 960** per §7101.1(b)(i).

- On **Settlement Date**, Servicing and **Servicing Contract Rights** transfer concurrent with sale.  
- **Cash-Released XChange®**: Concurrent transfer per §§6101.7(a), 7101.1(b)(i), Exhibit 28A.

- **Seller must**:
  - Verify Servicer’s Document Custodian has a **Tri-Party** with the Servicer.  
  - **Deliver Notes + related docs + all assignments + Form 1034E** (or Note Delivery Cover Sheet) to the Servicer’s Document Custodian (must be an **eligible custodian** in Exhibit 43 for non-eMortgages).  
  - Verify MERS registration/assignment statuses (§6301.6).

  - **Update tracking system** (§2202.2(b)).

### (ii) **Subsequent** Transfers of Servicing
**Transferor & Transferee Document Custodians must cooperate** (see Document Custody Procedures Handbook).

**Within 30 days after Effective Date of Transfer, Transferor Servicer must:**
- Complete **Form 1034T** (Document Custodial Certification Schedule for Transfer of Custody and Subsequent Transfers of Servicing) and forward it with the **executed STOS Agreement + Final Mortgage List** (§7101.1(b)(ii)) to the **Transferor Document Custodian** so it can send **Notes & assignments** to the **Transferee Document Custodian**.  
- Identify to Transferee Servicer all **LNA** loans.

**Within 30 days after Effective Date, Transferor Document Custodian must:**
- Verify **STOS + Final Mortgage List** accompanies the delivery request.

  - **Transport** Notes only via **national commercial/bonded carrier/courier**.

**Transferee Servicer must:**

- Provide documentation if it **elects to hold MERS assignments** in Mortgage files (§6304.1).  
- Remains **responsible** for the Note and related documents and **all reps & warranties** (see §8107.1(d)(iv) for LNAs).

**Transferee Document Custodian must:**
- Have a **Tri-Party Agreement** in effect with the Transferee Servicer (§2202.3) **before** Effective Date.  
- Verify **STOS approval + Final Mortgage List** accompanies custody transfer.

  - Match **Freddie Mac loan number** (or validate against Transferee data), **Borrower name**, **Property address** (ZIP excluded).  
  - Confirm **original Note** (or approved **LNA**), and **proper/complete endorsement chain** to **blank** from original payee.  
  - **Remove & destroy** any **recordable but unrecorded assignment** from Transferor to Freddie Mac.  
- On its own behalf and Transferee Servicer’s, **complete/execute/deliver Form 1034T to Freddie Mac within 180 days** after the Effective Date; **retain** Form 1034T **≥ 3 months** post-certification (§8107.2(d)).  
- **Update** document tracking to reflect custody transfer.

### (iii) **Subsequent Transfers without transfer of custody**
- **Transferor Servicer**:
  - **Prepare assignment** to Transferee; **record & certify** it unless MERS-registered and Transferee is a MERS Member.  
  - **Prepare/execute Form 1034T** and deliver it **and the assignment** to the Document Custodian **within 30 days** after Effective Date.  
  - Identify all **LNA** loans to Transferee.
- **Transferee Servicer**:
  - If elected to hold **MERS assignments**, provide evidence to Document Custodian (§6304.1).  
  - **Assume responsibility** for Note completeness and **all reps & warranties** (§8107.1(d)(iv)).  
- **Document Custodian**:
  - **Remove & destroy** any recordable but unrecorded assignment from Transferor to Freddie Mac.  
  - **Execute Form 1034T**, send copy to Freddie Mac **within 180 days** after Effective Date; **retain ≥ 3 months** (§8107.2(d)).

### (iv) **Transfers of custody only** (no Servicing transfer)
- **Servicer**: Prepare/execute **Form 1034T** (leave Transferee Servicer info blank) with Mortgage List; deliver to **Transferor Document Custodian** so custody can move on the **Effective Date of Transfer**; identify **LNA** loans.
- **Transferor Document Custodian**: Within **30 days after Effective Date**, deliver **Notes + related documents + all assignments + executed Form 1034T** to **Transferee Document Custodian** (carrier/courier only).
- **Transferee Document Custodian**:  
  - **Notify** receipt status **within 35 days**.  
  - Perform §6304.3(a) **verifications** (as referenced in §7101.4(c)(i)).  
  - **Update** tracking for custody change.
