> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Sets the review standards Freddie Mac applies to **Transfers of Servicing (ToS)**, the due-diligence duties of **Transferor** and **Transferee** Servicers, and **conditions that must be met** for approval.

---

## (a) Freddie Mac Review
Freddie Mac may approve, approve with conditions, or deny any ToS at its **sole discretion**. Approval will be **denied** if, in Freddie’s judgment, the transfer is not in Freddie’s best interests or if:
- Either Servicer **cannot adequately service** Mortgages/REO or meet Servicing Contract obligations.  
- The **Final Mortgage List** includes loans **90+ days delinquent** or **previously modified** (these must be handled via **Voluntary Partial Cancellation** per Ch. 7102).  
- Either party is not an **approved Seller/Servicer** or is out of compliance / subject to disqualification or suspension (Sec. 2301.2).

Freddie’s review emphasizes: financial capacity, outstanding obligations (e.g., repurchases), delinquency/REO ratios, reporting, and **Servicer Success Scorecard** results. Negotiated terms (e.g., recourse) may extend review time.

---

## (b) Transferor Servicer Review
Must **cooperate** with Transferee’s due diligence on:
- Loans in the transfer, **Custodial Accounts**, Purchase Document obligations, and any **alternatives to foreclosure**.  
- Provide any **missing data/documents** needed for Transferee to meet Guide obligations.  
- Provide **post-transfer review results** to Freddie Mac upon request.

---

## (c) Transferee Servicer Review
Must perform due diligence on:
- Loans, **Custodial Accounts**, assumed obligations (e.g., payoff remittance), and any outstanding/active **loss-mitigation** alternatives.  
- Consider **internal/external audit reports**, including recent **Freddie Mac audits**.  
- Provide **post-transfer review results** to Freddie upon request.  
- Note: Transferor may **not** share its Servicer Success Scorecard without Freddie’s **prior written approval**.

---

## (d) Additional Conditions of Approval

### (i) Mortgage Insurance (MI) Coverage
- ToS must comply with each MI’s requirements.  
- Transferor must obtain each MI’s **commitment to continue coverage** for Transferee **before** the Effective Date; if not, obtain equivalent coverage from another MI.

No loan in the transfer may be subject to:
- A **contractual prohibition** on ToS (term of business/condition of purchase).  
- **Outstanding requirements** the Transferor must complete pre-transfer, including:  
  - **GreenCHOICE®** eligible improvements not completed (Sec. 4606).  
  - **CHOICERenovation®** eligible renovations not completed (Subsequent ToS: Sec. 4607.6 / 4607.17; CTOS under 4607.1(b) requires Freddie’s prior approval; **CHOICEReno eXPress®** renovations must be complete).

### (iii) Additional Delivery Data for CTOS

- If at delivery: **Transferor** submits.  
- If after delivery: **Transferee** may submit **only with Freddie’s prior written approval**, and Transferor must provide accurate file copies to support data.

### (iv) Mortgages in a Trial Period
- Transferor must **notify** Transferee of any loans in a **Trial Period Plan** and confirm Transferee will assume added responsibilities.  
- Must **flag** in Servicing Transfer Manager (STM) and identify program type on **Proposed** and **Final Mortgage Lists** (e.g., HAMP®, Standard, Streamlined, **Flex Modification®**).

### (v) Modified Mortgages — Step-Rate / Partial Forbearance
- Transferor must **affirmatively indicate** in STM any modified loans with **step-rate** or **partial principal forbearance**.

### (vi) Mortgages Modified Electronically
- If modified electronically (Sec. 1401.17), Transferor must **identify** in STM.  
- See Sec. **9205.3(c)** for **HAMP eModification** requirements.

### (vii) Maintain Financial Eligibility
- **Before** the Effective Date, each Servicer must evaluate whether the ToS affects its ability to maintain Freddie-required **capitalization, profitability, liquidity, and funding**.
