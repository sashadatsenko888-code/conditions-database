> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview
This section specifies the **remittance cycle** applicable to all Mortgages sold under the **Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs.  
Freddie Mac defines and applies a standardized schedule for the timing of principal and interest remittances from Servicers.

---

## Standard Remittance Cycle
- All Mortgages sold under the **Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs are subject to the **Standard Remittance Cycle**.  
- Under this cycle:
  - Servicers must **remit borrower payments** of principal and interest to Freddie Mac **by the scheduled remittance date**, as defined in the Purchase Documents.  
  - The schedule ensures **uniform cash flow** and **predictable investor payments** for Freddie Mac securities (UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PCs).  

---

## Purpose of Standardization
The Standard Remittance Cycle provides:
- **Consistency** across all Servicers and programs  
- **Predictable timing** of investor distributions  
- **Simplified reconciliation** and accounting for Freddie Mac and counterparties
