Effective Date: 08/13/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines the **Seller’s indemnification obligations** to Freddie Mac for losses, claims, or liabilities arising from the **Seller’s sale or offering** of Freddie Mac securities — **UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PCs**.  
It ensures that Freddie Mac is protected from third-party claims resulting from **Seller misstatements, omissions, or violations** during securities offerings.

---

## Indemnification Requirement

The Seller must **indemnify and hold Freddie Mac harmless**, including its:

- **Directors**  
- **Officers**  
- **Employees**  
- **Successors and assigns**  
- **Fiscal and transfer agents**

from **any and all losses, damages, claims, demands, actions, suits, or liabilities** (joint or several) related to the Seller’s actions in the sale or offering of UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PCs.

This obligation includes **reimbursement for legal or investigative expenses** reasonably incurred by Freddie Mac in connection with any such matter.

---

## Causes of Indemnifiable Liability

The Seller’s indemnification covers liabilities that arise from or are based upon:

1. **False or misleading statements**  
   Any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in **offering materials** used by the Seller, its agents, or underwriters,  
   *excluding the official Freddie Mac Offering Circulars.*

2. **Material omissions**  
   Any omission (or alleged omission) to state a material fact necessary to make statements not misleading under the circumstances in which they were made.

3. **Other acts or failures to act**  
   Any act, negligence, or failure by the Seller, its underwriters, or agents in connection with such sale or offering, including but not limited to:
   - **Breach of Section 6201.16** (Disclosure Requirements)  
   - **Violation of warranties or representations** made under § 6201.16  

> In short, Freddie Mac is not responsible for the Seller’s offering practices or disclosure errors — the Seller bears full liability for all resulting consequences.
