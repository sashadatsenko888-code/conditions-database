## Overview
This section defines Freddie Mac’s **Guarantor Pricing** framework — the pricing terms, definitions, and conditions applicable to Sellers participating in the **Guarantor** or **MultiLender Swap** programs through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.  
It governs how pricing is communicated, accepted, and modified via Rate Sheets.

---

## (a) Defined Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Guarantor Pricing** | Includes Credit Fees in Yield, Credit Fee in Yield Add-Ons, negotiated adjustments, buyup and buydown ratios, maximum buyup/buydown limits, and other negotiated Credit Fees or credits that Freddie Mac may include from time to time. |
| **Pricing Day** | The calendar day (or days) on which Freddie Mac makes Guarantor Pricing available in Loan Selling Advisor. |
| **Rate Sheet** | The “Rate Sheet Results” screen in Loan Selling Advisor that displays Guarantor Pricing components, eligible products, effective dates, Settlement Dates, and any applicable business stipulations. |

---

## (b) Pricing Day and Notification
- The **Pricing Day** is listed on the Seller’s Rate Sheet.  
- If the Pricing Day falls on a **non-Business Day**, Freddie Mac publishes Guarantor Pricing on the **next Business Day**.  
- Each Rate Sheet includes:
  - All **Guarantor Pricing components**;  
  - **Eligible Mortgage products**;  
  - **Effective dates** and **Settlement Dates**;  
  - Any special terms stated under “Business Arrangement Stipulations.”

---

## (c) Taking Out Purchase Contracts
- A Seller may **take out Purchase Contracts** for a given month **only after** Freddie Mac posts Guarantor Pricing on the Rate Sheet applicable to that Settlement month.  
- No contracts can be initiated based on outdated or unpublished Rate Sheets.

---

## (d) Acceptance of Guarantor Pricing
- Delivery of Mortgages eligible under a Rate Sheet constitutes the Seller’s **acceptance** of all pricing terms listed on that Rate Sheet.  
- This acceptance is **automatic upon delivery** — no separate confirmation is required.

---

## (e) Amendments and Termination
- Freddie Mac reserves the right to **amend, supplement, revise, or terminate** any part of the Guarantor Pricing framework upon **written notice** to the Seller.  
- Notice may take the form of **new Rate Sheet publication** in Loan Selling Advisor.  
- Changes become effective as of the date listed on the updated Rate Sheet.  
- **Previously executed contracts** are not affected by subsequent changes.
