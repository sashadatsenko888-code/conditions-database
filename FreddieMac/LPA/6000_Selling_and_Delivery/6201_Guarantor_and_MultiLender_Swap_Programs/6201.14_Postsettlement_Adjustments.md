Section: 6201.14 – Postsettlement Adjustments for Mortgages Purchased under the Guarantor and MultiLender Swap Programs  
Effective Date: 09/10/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines the **postsettlement adjustment procedures** for Mortgages purchased under the **Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs when discrepancies occur between:
- The **settlement balance** (aggregate UPB as of the Settlement Date), and  
- The **verified balance** (UPB confirmed for purchase).  

It ensures accurate pooling, accounting, and principal reconciliation following delivery and settlement.

---

## (a) Excess Settlement Balance – Seller Receives Back Unfunded Mortgages

If Freddie Mac determines that:
- The **settlement balance** > the **verified balance**, and  
- The **settlement balance** > the **original principal balance** of the related UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PC,  

then Freddie Mac will **transfer back ownership** of the smallest number of **unfunded Mortgages** whose combined UPB (as of Settlement Date) equals or exceeds the **difference** between the settlement balance and the verified balance.

If this returned amount **exceeds the difference**, the Seller must:
- Report the excess as a **principal prepayment** (Mortgage paid in full), and  
- **Remit** the overage promptly per **Sections 8302.3(e)** and **8303.2(b)**.

> ⚠️ The Seller **cannot** offset this discrepancy against later principal collections without Freddie Mac’s written approval.

---

## (b) Reporting Requirements After Settlement
The Seller must ensure that:
- The **Loan-Level Transaction Report** (or any other accounting report) **accurately reflects**:
  - All principal actually collected after Settlement, and  
  - Any prepayment related to the transfer of unfunded Mortgages.  

Principal reduction amounts must precisely match verified postsettlement activity each accounting period.

---

## (c) Deficit Settlement Balance – Seller Obligated to Remedy

If Freddie Mac determines that:
- The **settlement balance** < the **verified balance**, and  
- The **settlement balance** < the **original principal balance** of the related UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PC,  

then Freddie Mac, **at its discretion**, may require the Seller to:

1. **Remit principal** to Freddie Mac equal to the difference,  
   **or**  
2. **Deliver additional Mortgages** eligible for inclusion in the related Pool, with a combined UPB at least equal to the shortfall.  

The Seller must complete this correction **within the time frame and method** specified by Freddie Mac.
