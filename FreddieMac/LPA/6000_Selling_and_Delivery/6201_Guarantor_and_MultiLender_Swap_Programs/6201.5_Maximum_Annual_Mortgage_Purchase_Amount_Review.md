## Overview
This section describes Freddie Mac’s right to **monitor and enforce the Seller’s Maximum Annual Mortgage Purchase Amount (MAMPA)** — the total volume of Mortgages Freddie Mac agrees to purchase from a Seller in a given calendar year.  

Freddie Mac may review, limit, or rescind commitments that would cause the Seller to exceed this threshold.

---

## Policy Summary

1. **Monitoring:**  
   After any commitment is made, Freddie Mac reviews the **aggregate amount of Mortgages** purchased from the Seller during the current calendar year.  

2. **Exceeding the Limit:**  
   - Freddie Mac, at its **sole discretion**, may:
     - Approve additional purchases that exceed the Seller’s MAMPA, **or**
     - **Rescind acceptance** (fully or partially) of any Mortgage offers that would cause the Seller to exceed this limit.  
   - Such rescission does **not entitle the Seller to any claims or compensation.**

3. **Fees for Exceeding the Limit:**  
   Freddie Mac reserves the right to **charge a fee** on the entire amount of any Purchase Contract that results in the Seller exceeding its MAMPA.

---

## Seller Responsibilities

- Sellers must **track cumulative sales volume** throughout the calendar year to avoid exceeding the established MAMPA.  
- Sellers should maintain internal records and reconciliation reports to ensure compliance before entering into new Purchase Contracts.  

---

## Freddie Mac Discretion

- The decision to exceed or enforce the MAMPA limit lies **entirely with Freddie Mac**.  
- Freddie Mac may exercise this discretion without prior notice and without liability for previously accepted commitments.
