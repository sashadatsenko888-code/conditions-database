## Overview
This section defines the relationship between **Freddie Mac-issued securities**—**UMBS®, MBS, and ARM PCs**—and the related Pools formed under the **Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs.  
It also specifies how Sellers are identified and how Freddie Mac may disclose pool information.

---

## (a) Offering Circulars and Acknowledgment
- **UMBS® and MBS** are offered for sale under the **Freddie Mac UMBS/MBS Offering Circular**.  
- **ARM PCs** are offered for sale under the **Freddie Mac ARM PC Offering Circular**.  
- By entering into **Pricing Identifier Terms (PITs)** with Freddie Mac, the **Seller acknowledges receipt** of the applicable Offering Circular and agrees to its terms.

> The Offering Circular governs the structure, risk, and disclosure of the securities backed by Mortgages delivered through Freddie Mac programs.

---

## (b) Seller Identification in Pool Disclosures
- A Seller may be identified by Freddie Mac as the **Seller and/or Servicer** of the Mortgages included in a Pool, in such manner as Freddie Mac determines.
- Typically, Seller identification appears in Freddie Mac’s **published monthly list of pool factors** for all Pools formed under the Guarantor program.

> “Pool factors” reflect the current outstanding principal balance as a percentage of the original balance for each Pool, disclosed monthly to investors.

---

## (c) Freddie Mac’s Right to Identify and Disclose
- Freddie Mac may, at its **sole discretion**, identify **UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PCs** as securities representing interests in Pools created under either the **Guarantor** or **MultiLender Swap** programs.
- Freddie Mac may **release information** about:
  - The Mortgages backing the Pools,  
  - The related UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PCs, and  
  - The programs under which they were issued.

> This disclosure authority supports transparency in the secondary market and compliance with securities disclosure obligations.
