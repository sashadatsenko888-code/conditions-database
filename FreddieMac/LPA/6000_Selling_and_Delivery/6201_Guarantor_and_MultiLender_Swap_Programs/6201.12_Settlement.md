Effective Date: 08/13/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section outlines the **settlement process** under the **Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs, including transfer of ownership, delivery of securities, postsettlement crediting, and failure contingencies.

---

## Settlement Mechanics

### Transfer of Ownership
- As of the **Settlement Date**, ownership of, and (subject to recourse, if applicable) the **risk of loss** on the Mortgages transfers **from the Seller to Freddie Mac**.  
- Freddie Mac will deliver to the Seller, in **Book-Entry Form**, the related **UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PCs** representing the interests in the Mortgages.

### Delivery and Verification
- The amount and details of securities delivered are:
  - **Determined by Freddie Mac**, and  
  - **Verified by the Seller** using the **Loan Selling Advisor® “View Wire Instructions”** screen.  
- Settlement occurs in accordance with **Section 6201.18** and the applicable Book-Entry requirements.

## Postsettlement Credits and Remittances

Following settlement, Freddie Mac will **credit or remit** to the Seller the total of:

1. **Interest amount**, calculated as:
   - For pools **without Note-level buyup/buydown** → Interest at the **Credit Fee in Yield (CFIY)** on the Mortgages, from the **Issue Date through the day before the Settlement Date**, inclusive.  
   - For pools **with Note-level buyup/buydown** → The **weighted average CFIY** of the Mortgages in the pool for the same period.

2. **UPB differential**, representing:  
   - The **excess**, if any, of the **aggregate UPB** as of the Settlement Date over the **aggregate original principal balance** of the related UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PCs.

The credited total will be **applied against** monthly invoiced fees (e.g., buydown, Gold Rush®, or Credit Fees).  
If the total **exceeds** the Seller’s postsettlement fees, Freddie Mac will **remit the net amount** to the Seller per **Chapter 6303**.

---

## Failure to Deliver or Purchase

If either party fails to perform on Settlement:

- **Seller fails to transfer Mortgages:**  
  Freddie Mac has **no obligation** to sell any related UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PCs.

- **Seller fails to purchase securities:**  
  Freddie Mac has **no obligation** to purchase any corresponding Mortgages.

This ensures that settlement obligations are **mutually dependent** and enforceable only upon full performance by both parties.
