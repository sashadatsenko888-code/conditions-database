## Overview
This section summarizes Freddie Mac’s **Guarantor and MultiLender Swap programs**, under which eligible **fixed-rate Mortgages** and **adjustable-rate Mortgages (ARMs)** may be sold to Freddie Mac in exchange for **Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities (UMBS®)**, **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**, or **Weighted Average Coupon (WAC) ARM Participation Certificates (PCs)**.

These programs allow Sellers to exchange Mortgage pools for Freddie Mac–guaranteed securities rather than cash, providing flexible secondary market execution options.

---

## Program Options

Mortgages may be sold to Freddie Mac through one of the following programs:

| Program | Description | Security Type |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program** | Conventional fixed-rate Mortgages are exchanged for a **UMBS or MBS** representing an undivided interest in those Mortgages. FHA and VA Mortgages are exchanged for an **MBS**. | UMBS® / MBS |
| **WAC ARM Guarantor Program** | Conventional ARMs are exchanged for a **WAC ARM PC** representing an undivided interest in the same Mortgages. | WAC ARM PC |
| **MultiLender Swap Program** | Conventional 10-, 15-, 20-, and 30-year fixed-rate Mortgages, and certain FHA/VA Mortgages, are pooled from multiple Sellers into a single **UMBS or MBS**. | UMBS® / MBS |

> Delivery under the Guarantor and MultiLender Swap programs is **optional**, but specific **Pricing Identifier Terms** may carry mandatory delivery requirements (see §1501.6).

## (a) Securities Issued under the Fixed-Rate Guarantor and MultiLender Swap Programs

### Eligible Mortgage Types
Freddie Mac issues securities for pools of the following **fixed-rate Mortgages**:

| Mortgage Type | Eligible Terms | Pooling Combinations |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Conventional Fixed-Rate | 10-, 15-, 20-, and 30-year | - 10- and 15-year terms → **15-year security**<br>- 20- and 30-year terms → **30-year security** |
| FHA and VA | 15-, 20-, and 30-year | - 20- and 30-year terms → **30-year security** |

Both **Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs use the same pooling rules for fixed-rate Mortgages.

---

## (b) Securities Issued under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program

The **WAC ARM Guarantor Program** issues **WAC ARM PCs** for eligible adjustable-rate Mortgages (ARMs).

### Pooling Criteria for WAC ARM PCs
Separate WAC ARM PCs are created based on specific ARM characteristics, including:

- **Index type**
- **Lookback period**
- **Initial and periodic interest rate caps**
- **Length of the initial fixed period**
- **Length of subsequent adjustment periods**
- **Presence or absence of prepayment penalties**

> See **Chapter 4401** and **Exhibit 17S (Available Mortgage Products)** for permitted ARM combinations.
