Effective Date: 08/13/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section outlines **mandatory disclosure requirements** for Freddie Mac–issued securities — **UMBS®, MBS, and ARM PCs** — under both the **Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs.  
It details how Freddie Mac discloses Pool data, and the Seller’s corresponding **compliance and reporting obligations** under federal securities laws.

---

## (a) Disclosure for UMBS®, MBS, and ARM PCs under the Guarantor Program

For each Pool formed under the **Guarantor program**, Freddie Mac will:

- Publish a **Pool Supplement (Form 15)** — Form 15A for UMBS/MBS or Form 15C for WAC ARM PCs — on  
  [https://capitalmarkets.freddiemac.com/mbs](https://capitalmarkets.freddiemac.com/mbs)  
  and via **Loan Selling Advisor®**.
- Make the Pool Supplement available upon request via **Investor Inquiry (800-336-3672).**

Freddie Mac relies on the **accuracy of Seller-provided data** for Mortgage and Servicing details.  
If the Pool Supplement contains any errors or omissions, the Seller must:

1. **Immediately notify** Freddie Mac, and  
2. **Provide corrections** for re-issuance.  

Neither the Seller nor its affiliates (as defined in **SEC Rule 405**) may use or distribute an **inaccurate Pool Supplement**.

Freddie Mac also publishes **monthly updates** with current Pool data via its website and information vendors (see Directory 1).

> See § 6202.2 for additional disclosure details.

---

## (b) Disclosure for UMBS® and MBS under the MultiLender Swap Program

For each Pool under the **MultiLender Swap** program, Freddie Mac will:

- Publish a **Pool Supplement (Form 15)** on its website and via Loan Selling Advisor®,  
  available the **first Business Day after SIFMA’s Class D monthly settlement date**.
- Provide copies upon request through **Investor Inquiry (800-336-3672).**

As with the Guarantor program, Freddie Mac depends on accurate data from the Seller.  
If any information is **inaccurate or incomplete**, the Seller must immediately inform Freddie Mac and correct it.  

Neither the Seller nor any affiliate may use such Pool Supplement if it contains inaccurate data.  
Freddie Mac also provides monthly data updates via its website and third-party information vendors.

> See § 6202.2 for additional UMBS/MBS disclosure guidance.

---

## (c) Seller’s Disclosure Obligations

The Seller’s **offer and sale** of UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PCs must fully comply with **federal securities laws** and Freddie Mac disclosure rules.

For every sale, the Seller must deliver (no later than contract execution):

1. The **most recent Offering Circular** (UMBS/MBS or ARM PC), including current supplements,  
2. The applicable **Pool Supplement**, and  
3. Any **Additional Supplement** required by law or § 6201.16(d).

If securities are sold to brokers, dealers, or distributors, the Seller must ensure those entities forward all required documents to investors **before or with sale confirmation**.

---

## (d) Seller’s Obligations for Additional Supplements

The Seller must promptly notify Freddie Mac in writing if any offering materials:

- Contain a **false statement of a material fact**, or  
- **Omit** a material fact that renders the materials misleading.

Such notice may require the Seller to prepare an **Additional Supplement** that corrects the information.  
The Seller may include **only content pre-approved by Freddie Mac** in that Additional Supplement.

---

## (e) Restrictions on Seller-Provided Information

The **Pool Supplement** and any **Additional Supplement** issued by Freddie Mac are the **only** publicly distributable information sources.

The Seller may **not**:

- Release data on **principal paydowns** or **pool factors**, or  
- Share any non-public Pool/Mortgage information  

unless Freddie Mac has already made it public **or** given **written consent**.

### Process to Disclose Non-Public Data
If Freddie Mac’s consent is obtained:
1. Seller must provide the information **in writing**, clearly stating:  
   > “This information was prepared by the Seller; Freddie Mac is not responsible for its accuracy or completeness.”
2. Within **one Business Day** of first release, the Seller must send a copy to:
FREDDIE MAC
1551 Park Run Drive
ATTN: Office of the Registrar
McLean, VA 22102
along with:
- The release date,  
- Seller name, address, and contact number.

Freddie Mac may make this submission available to **any person upon request**.
