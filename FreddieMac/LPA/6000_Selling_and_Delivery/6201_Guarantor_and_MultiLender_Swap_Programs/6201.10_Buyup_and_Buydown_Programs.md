## Overview
This section explains Freddie Mac’s **buyup and buydown programs** available for Sellers under the **Fixed-Rate Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs.  
These programs allow Sellers to adjust the **Credit Fee in Yield (CFIY)** on Mortgages through cash payments or credits, either at the **note level** or **loan level**, to manage yield and servicing spreads.

---

## (a) Adjustments to Credit Fees in Yield

When taking out a **Fixed-Rate Guarantor** or **MultiLender Swap Contract**, the Seller may adjust the Credit Fee in Yield using one of the following options:
- **Note-level program**, or  
- **Loan-level program** (if permitted under the Seller’s Pricing Identifier Terms).

### Adjustment Basis
The adjustment is determined by:
- The **Note Rate**
- The **Coupon**
- The **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread**

For note-level programs, the Credit Fee in Yield is adjusted **uniformly** for all Mortgages with the same Note Rate and remaining maturity.  
For loan-level programs, the Seller may select specific Mortgages for adjustment.

> *“Credit Fee in Yield” includes all components: base fee, add-ons, and negotiated adjustments.*

---

## (b) Selection of Applicable Option
### Note-Level Program
At the time of taking out a Purchase Contract, the Seller must choose one of the following:
1. **Buyup and Buydown**  
2. **Buydown only**  
3. **Buyup only**  
4. **Neither buyup nor buydown**

### Loan-Level Program
At delivery, the Seller selects the applicable option for each Mortgage.  
If the Seller fails to deliver required **ULDD Data Points** for buyup/buydown, the Mortgage **cannot be allocated** to the Purchase Contract.

> The Seller may update the buyup or buydown amount until the Purchase Contract reaches **settlement locked** status.

---

## (c) Buyup and Buydown Fees
- For a **buyup**, Freddie Mac **pays the Seller** in exchange for an **increase** in the Credit Fee in Yield.  
- For a **buydown**, the **Seller pays Freddie Mac** in exchange for a **decrease** in the Credit Fee in Yield.  
- Net buyup proceeds and buydown fees are **offset** and settled per **Section 6303.2(a)**.

---

## (d) Calculation of Credit Fee in Yield Adjustment
Freddie Mac determines the Credit Fee in Yield adjustment using the following formula:

- **Positive result → Buyup** (subject to the maximum buyup limit).  
- **Negative result → Buydown** (subject to the maximum buydown limit, but never below zero).  
- A Note Rate must always be ≥ (Coupon + adjusted Credit Fee in Yield + Minimum Contract Servicing Spread).

---

## (e) Calculation of Buyup and Buydown Fees
- For each basis point (0.010%) adjustment in CFIY, a payment equals a **fixed percent (in basis points)** of the **UPB** of the Mortgage.  
- The exact rate depends on:
  - Note Rate,
  - Mortgage product type, and
  - Whether a **buyup** or **buydown** applies.

---

## (f) Application of Buyup Maximum Amount
- Mortgages are subject to the **maximum buyup amount** defined in the Seller’s Purchase Documents.  
- The Seller may input a lower maximum.  
- If left blank, **Loan Selling Advisor® automatically applies** the default maximum stated in the Purchase Documents.

---

## (g) WAC ARM Guarantor Program Exclusion
Buyup and buydown options **are not permitted** under the **WAC ARM Guarantor Program.**

---

## (h) Payment Processing
All buyup proceeds and buydown fees are processed and settled in accordance with **Section 6303.2(a)**.
