Effective Date: 03/02/2016  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines **additional Seller representations and warranties** required under the **Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs, supplementing those stated elsewhere in the **Purchase Documents**.

These warranties ensure data accuracy, loan balance integrity, and collateral valuation consistency between origination and settlement.

---

## Seller Representations and Warranties

The Seller represents and warrants the following as of the **Settlement Date**:

### (1) Accuracy of Purchase Information
All **purchase information** provided in connection with the transaction must be **true, correct, and complete** as of the Settlement Date.

> This includes all delivery data, pricing inputs, UPB figures, and Mortgage identifiers submitted through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

### (2) Consistency of Principal Balances
The **ending principal balance** reflected in the **Loan-Level Transaction Report** (as transmitted by the Servicer) at the close of the **first monthly accounting reporting period** following the Settlement Date must:
- Equal the **aggregate Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB)** of the related Mortgages sold to Freddie Mac.

> This ensures accounting consistency between Freddie Mac’s securities pool records and the Seller’s delivery data.

---

### (3) Appraised Value Warranty – Standard Mortgages
As of the **Settlement Date**, the **appraised value of the Mortgaged Premises** must be **at least equal** to the **appraised value** as of the **date of origination** of such Mortgage.

> This prevents any decline in collateral value prior to transfer and protects Freddie Mac’s investment position.

---

### (4) Appraised Value Warranty – Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages
For **Construction Conversion** and **Renovation Mortgages**, the Seller warrants that as of the **Settlement Date**, the **appraised value** of the Mortgaged Premises is **at least equal** to the **appraised value stated in the most recent appraisal report** (effective date basis).

> This applies regardless of project completion status and includes final inspections or draw disbursement stages.
