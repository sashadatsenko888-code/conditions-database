## Overview
This section defines the **scope and conditions** of Freddie Mac’s obligation to issue or sell **Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities (UMBS®)**, **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**, or **Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Participation Certificates (ARM PCs)** in exchange for Mortgages delivered under the **Guarantor** or **MultiLender Swap** programs.

---

## Freddie Mac’s Obligation
Freddie Mac’s obligation to sell or deliver UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PCs in exchange for Mortgages is **not absolute**.  
It is **subject to the following conditions**:

1. **Mortgage Eligibility**  
   - The Mortgages must meet all **eligibility requirements** established in the Freddie Mac Guide and applicable Purchase Documents.

2. **Seller Compliance with Maximum Annual Mortgage Purchase Amount (MAMPA)**  
   - Freddie Mac’s obligation applies **only** if the Seller remains within any **Maximum Annual Mortgage Purchase Amount** established by Freddie Mac.  
   - See **Section 6201.5** for enforcement provisions.

3. **Compliance with Purchase Documents**  
   - The Seller must comply with **all requirements** of the applicable **Purchase Documents**, including delivery procedures, pricing terms, pooling criteria, and representations and warranties.

---

## Freddie Mac’s Discretion
- Freddie Mac retains the **sole discretion** to determine whether:
  - Mortgages satisfy purchase eligibility requirements, and  
  - The Seller remains in compliance with MAMPA and other contractual obligations.
- Failure to meet any of these conditions may release Freddie Mac from its obligation to deliver UMBS®, MBS, or ARM PCs to the Seller.

---

## Practical Impact for Sellers
Before submitting Mortgages under the Guarantor or MultiLender Swap programs, Sellers should verify that:
- Each loan satisfies Freddie Mac’s eligibility criteria.
- Aggregate sales remain within the Seller’s annual purchase limit.
- All delivery and documentation standards are met to ensure issuance of the corresponding security.
