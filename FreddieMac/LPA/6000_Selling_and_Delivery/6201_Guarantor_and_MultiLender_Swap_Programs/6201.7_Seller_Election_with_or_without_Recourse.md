Section: 6201.7 – Seller’s Election to Sell with or without Recourse under the Guarantor and MultiLender Swap Programs  
Effective Date: 03/02/2022  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s requirements and conditions for **Seller elections to sell Mortgages with or without recourse** under the **Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs.  
The Seller’s election determines which party bears the credit risk associated with Borrower default and foreclosure outcomes.

---

## (a) Sales **with Recourse**

### Definition  
A **recourse sale** means that the **Seller retains credit risk** — the Seller must absorb losses if the Borrower defaults.  

### Key Obligations  
When Mortgages are sold **with recourse**, the Seller:
- **Bears all risks and costs** of Borrower default, including **foreclosure costs**.  
- Must **repurchase** the Mortgage (plus accrued interest) upon:
  - Completion of the foreclosure sale, or  
  - Delivery of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.  
- May **voluntarily repurchase**:
  - Any Mortgage **90 days delinquent** (per §§ 3602.4–3602.6), or  
  - Any Mortgage **for which foreclosure has been initiated.**

### Financial Condition Review  
Before approving recourse sales:
- Freddie Mac **reviews the Seller’s financial capacity** to meet recourse obligations.  
- If insufficient, Freddie Mac may:
  - Require **additional assurances** (guarantees, collateral, etc.).  
  - **Restrict or prohibit** further recourse sales.

### Ongoing Monitoring  
Freddie Mac may:
- Require periodic **financial statements** specific to recourse exposure.  
- Demand **additional guarantees or collateral**.  
- Treat failure to comply as **breach of Purchase Documents**.

### Regulatory Compliance  
- The Seller **represents and warrants** that all recourse obligations comply with **federal and State regulations**.  
- In case of **Transfer of Servicing**, the **Transferee Servicer** must be Freddie Mac–approved and may assume the same recourse obligations.

### Documentation  
- Each Note must include the **proper recourse endorsement**, as described in § 6301.3.

---

## (b) Sales **without Recourse**

When Mortgages are sold **without recourse**:
- Freddie Mac assumes the **full credit risk** associated with Borrower default.  
- The Seller’s liability is limited to standard **representations and warranties** in the Purchase Documents.
