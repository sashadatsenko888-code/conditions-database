## Overview
This section outlines Freddie Mac’s **purchase eligibility requirements** for Mortgages sold under the **Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs.  
It defines Note Rate, Servicing Spread, and Credit Fee parameters for fixed-rate and ARM Mortgages, as well as special provisions for lender-paid mortgage insurance.

---

## (a) Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program

### Eligibility
Freddie Mac purchases fixed-rate Mortgages under the Guarantor program that meet the following pricing formula:

> **Note Rate ≥ (Requested Coupon + Credit Fee in Yield ± Buyup/Buydown + Minimum Contract Servicing Spread)**

### Servicing Spread Requirements
| Type | Minimum | Maximum | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| Standard | 0.250% | 0.500% | Must meet or exceed Minimum Servicing Spread |
| With lender-paid MI (annual/monthly) | ≥0.250% | ≤0.500% | Must include MI premium amount |

### Reference
Refer to **Chapter 6202** for pooling requirements for fixed-rate Mortgages under the Guarantor program.

---

## (b) MultiLender Swap Program

### Eligibility
Freddie Mac purchases fixed-rate Mortgages under the MultiLender Swap program where the **Note Rate** (adjusted for buyup/buydown and including any lender-paid MI premium) falls **within the posted Note Rate range** for that program.

### Servicing Spread Requirements
| Type | Minimum | Maximum | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| All Mortgages | 0.250% | 0.500% | Must meet or exceed Minimum Servicing Spread |

### Reference
Refer to **Chapter 6202** for pooling requirements for fixed-rate Mortgages under the MultiLender Swap program.

## (c) WAC ARM Guarantor Program

### Margin and Servicing Spread
- Refer to **Section 4401.1(b)** for SOFR-indexed ARM margin requirements.  
- The **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread** must be **≥0.250%** and **≤2.00%**.  
- For ARMs with **lender-paid MI (annual/monthly)**, the spread must include the MI premium amount.

---

### Discrete Servicing Spread Categories

| Spread Type | Description | Variance Rule |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Minimum Coupon Servicing Spread** | Applies from purchase date until Note Rate is capped by the Initial or Periodic Cap. | Cannot vary >0.250% from other two spreads |
| **Minimum Margin Servicing Spread** | Applies when adjusted Note Rate equals Index + Margin. | Cannot vary >0.250% from others |
| **Minimum Lifetime Ceiling Servicing Spread** | Applies when Note Rate is limited by the Lifetime Ceiling through loan maturity. | Cannot vary >0.250% from others |

> ARMs with differing values for these three categories are classified as **variable servicing spread ARMs**.

### Reference
Refer to **Chapter 6202** for ARM pooling requirements under the WAC ARM Guarantor program.
