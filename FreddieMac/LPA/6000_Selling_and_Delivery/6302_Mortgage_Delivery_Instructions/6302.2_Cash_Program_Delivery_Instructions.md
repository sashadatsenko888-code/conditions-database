Section: 6302.2 – Cash Program Delivery Instructions  
Effective Date: 10/08/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6302.2 establishes requirements for **delivering eligible Mortgages under the Cash Program** — including contract validation, purchase tolerance, and ULDD data delivery rules for both fixed-rate and ARM Mortgages.

---

## (a) General Requirements

### Eligibility and Contract Setup
- Sellers may deliver:
  - **Fixed-rate Mortgages** after taking out a **Cash Contract** (see Sections **6101.3** and **6101.4**), or  
  - **Adjustable-rate Mortgages (ARMs)** after taking out an **ARM Cash Contract** (see Section **6102.2(a)**).
- Upon taking out a Cash Contract, Freddie Mac immediately provides a **Contract Number** (`Investor Contract Identifier` in ULDD).

### Delivery Type
- **Delivery is mandatory**, unless the contract is a **Best Efforts Contract** (see Section 6101.4).
- Each Purchase Contract Confirmation must have a **minimum Contract Commitment Amount** of **$1,000**.

---

## (b) Purchase Tolerance

The **purchase tolerance** defines the acceptable range between the **delivered loan amount** and the **committed contract amount**:

> Tolerance = Contract Commitment Amount ± the greater of:
> - **$10,000**, or  
> - **2.5%** of the Contract Commitment Amount

If delivery falls short of the required amount **minus the tolerance**, the Seller must follow **pair-off procedures** (see Section 6401.1).

---

## (c) Data Delivery Instructions

### (i) Mortgages Delivered under the Cash Program
For Mortgages purchased by Freddie Mac under the Cash Program, the Seller must provide the following ULDD Data Points:

#### **Required ULDD Data for Cash Deliveries**

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| **385** | `Loan Acquisition Scheduled UPB Amount` | — | For fixed-rate Mortgages, enter the scheduled UPB as of the **Funding Date**. <br>For ARMs, enter either the scheduled or actual UPB as of the Funding Date. <br><br>The UPB must include reductions for: <br>• Principal due through the Funding Date month (even if not collected) <br>• Principal from prepaid installments <br>• Any curtailments received on or before the Delivery Date |
| **440** | `Last Paid Installment Due Date (DDLPI)` | — | For newly originated Mortgages, enter the date **through which interest is scheduled to be paid**. <br>If prepaid interest exists, enter the date **through which prepaid interest applies**. |

---

### (ii) Mortgages Where the Lender Credits Borrower Interest at Closing
For Mortgages where the **lender credits the Borrower interest at closing** (covering the first day of the month through the day before the Note Date):

- The **first monthly P&I payment** is due **on the first day of the month immediately following closing**.  
- The Seller must **represent and warrant** that the interest credit was applied at closing.  
- Additionally, the Seller must deliver the following ULDD Data Point:

#### **Required ULDD Data for Interest-Credit Mortgages**

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| **440** | `Last Paid Installment Due Date (DDLPI)` | — | For fixed-rate Mortgages, enter the **Note Date** or the **first day of the month of closing**. <br>For ARMs, enter the **first day of the month of closing**. |

---

## Practical Meaning
This section governs how Sellers:
- Align their delivery with **contract and funding amounts**,  
- Report **accurate principal balances and interest periods**,  
- Avoid pair-off penalties by meeting contract tolerance limits, and  
- Ensure that **borrower interest credits** are properly disclosed in ULDD.

Frequent Freddie audit flags related to this section:
> “UPB does not reconcile with Funding Date,”  
> “DDLPI incorrect for prepaid interest,”  
> “Cash delivery under minimum tolerance,”  
> “Missing interest credit representation.”
