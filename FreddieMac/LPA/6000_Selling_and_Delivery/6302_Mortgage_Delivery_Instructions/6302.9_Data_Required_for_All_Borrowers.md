## QC/Validation Tips
- Exactly one `Primary` borrower; others `Secondary`.  
- Living Trust: use Settlor’s ITIN/SSN; HMDA values come from Settlor.  
- HMDA “visual/surname” indicators must align with application channel.  
- Education data only when required; never use `Lender Trained Counseling`.  
- Credit Score Provider format must match CRC/affiliate code specs.  
- Mailing address: if `same as property = true`, leave fields blank.
