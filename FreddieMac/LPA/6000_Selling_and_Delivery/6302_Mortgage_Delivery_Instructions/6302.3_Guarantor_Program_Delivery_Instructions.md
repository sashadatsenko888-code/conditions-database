Section: 6302.3 – Guarantor Program Delivery Instructions  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6302.3 defines the **data, delivery, pooling, and certification requirements** for Mortgages sold under Freddie Mac’s **Guarantor Program**, including fixed-rate and WAC ARM contracts.  
It also introduces tolerance rules, energy-efficient loan tagging (Green MBS), and certification timelines for expedited settlement cycles.

---

## (a) Guarantor Program Requirements and Instructions

- When a Seller takes out a **Guarantor Contract**, Freddie Mac immediately provides a **Contract Number** (`Investor Contract Identifier` in ULDD).  
- For **WAC ARM Guarantor Contracts**, the Seller must select the appropriate **WAC ARM Security Product** according to ARM characteristics.

---

## (b) Purchase Tolerance

- Any part of the **Contract Commitment Amount** may be delivered, provided the **minimum pool size** is met.  
- The Seller may **increase** the Guarantor contract amount up to the **remaining balance of the Commitment Amount plus the applicable tolerance**.

---

## (c) Data Delivery Instructions

### (i) Mortgages Sold under the Guarantor Program
For Mortgages delivered under the Guarantor Program, the Seller must provide the following ULDD Data Points:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| **385** | `Loan Acquisition Scheduled UPB Amount` | — | Include principal reductions for: <br>• Payments due through settlement month (even if uncollected) <br>• Principal from prepaid installments received before settlement <br>• Partial prepayments (curtailments) received on/before Delivery Date |
| **440** | `Last Paid Installment Due Date (DDLPI)` | — | For new Mortgages, enter date **through which interest is scheduled to be paid**. <br>For prepaid interest, enter the date **through which prepaid interest applies**. |
| **368** | `Investor Feature Identifier` | **J99** | Use only for **Green MBS** Mortgages — properties with qualifying **HERS** or **ENERGY STAR** certifications (see Section 6202.3(f)). |

---

### (ii) Mortgages with Lender Crediting Borrower Interest at Closing
If the lender credits the Borrower for interest covering **the first day of the month through the day before the Note Date**, then:
- The Borrower’s first monthly **P&I payment** is due **the first day of the month following closing**.
- The Seller represents and warrants that the interest credit was applied.  
- The Seller must deliver:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| **440** | `Last Paid Installment Due Date (DDLPI)` | — | Fixed-rate: enter **Note Date** or **first day of closing month**.<br>ARM: enter **first day of closing month**. |

---

### (iii) ARMs with Next Interest Change Date in Month of Settlement
If an ARM’s **next Interest Change Date** falls in the **same month as settlement**, the Seller must report loan data **as if the change has already occurred**.

Example: Loan delivered Feb 27 for Mar 23 settlement; next change = Mar 1.  
→ Report the following:

| ULDD Data Point | Instruction |
|------------------|-------------|
| `Next Rate Adjustment Effective Date` | March 1 of the following year |
| `Per Change Rate Adjustment Effective Date (First)` | March 1 of the current year |
| `Current Interest Rate Percent` | The Note Rate in effect as of March 1 (current year) |
| `Principal and Interest Payment Amount` | Payment amount effective as of March 1 (current year) |

---

### (iv) ARMs Past the First Interest Change Date
ARMs that are **past their first Interest Change Date** may be delivered **together** with ARMs that have **not yet reached** the first change date.

---

## (d) Pooling Requirements
Refer to:
- **Chapter 6202** — pooling for fixed-rate Mortgages (Guarantor or MultiLender Swap)  
- **WAC ARM Guarantor** pooling requirements — also within Chapter 6202.

---

## (e) Security Wire Instructions
- Required for **all pools**.  
- See:
  - Section **2201.1** — Certificate of Incumbency  
  - Sections **6203.8** and **6204.8** — security wire process  
  - Section **2403.11** — authorized Loan Selling Advisor® users, user roles, and submission forms.

---

## (f) Settlement Cycle of Less Than Five Days
For Guarantor deliveries with a **Settlement Cycle < 5 days**:
- The **Document Custodian** must **certify** Mortgages in **Loan Selling Advisor® by 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Final Delivery Date**.  
- Certification timing must meet Section **6301.8** delivery completion rules.

---

## Practical Meaning
This section defines Freddie’s operational standards for **pooling and data submission** under Guarantor contracts.  
It ensures Sellers correctly represent UPB, prepaid interest, ARM change cycles, and Green MBS identifiers — while maintaining strict certification timing for expedited settlements.

Typical Freddie audit comments linked to this section:
> “Incorrect UPB at settlement,”  
> “DDLPI misaligned with prepaid interest,”  
> “Missing Green MBS IFI (J99),”  
> “ARM adjustment data inconsistent with change month,”  
> “Custodian certification delay (<5-day cycle).”
