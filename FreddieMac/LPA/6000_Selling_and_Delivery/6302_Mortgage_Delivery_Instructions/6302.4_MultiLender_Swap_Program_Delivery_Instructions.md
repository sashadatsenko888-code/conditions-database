Section: 6302.4 – MultiLender Swap Program Delivery Instructions  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6302.4 governs the **delivery, tolerance, and certification requirements** for Mortgages sold under the **MultiLender Swap Program** — where multiple Sellers deliver Mortgages into a single Freddie Mac security pool.  
It defines contract setup, purchase tolerance, ULDD delivery data, and timing for accelerated settlements.

---

## (a) General Requirements

- Upon taking out a **MultiLender Swap Contract**, the Seller receives an immediate **Contract Number** (`Investor Contract Identifier` in ULDD).  
- The Seller must **complete delivery** of all Mortgages **on or before the Final Delivery Date** specified in the contract.  
- The **Contract Commitment Amount** must be at least equal to the **minimum commitment amount** (see subsection (d)).  
- For general MultiLender Swap guidance, refer to **Chapter 6205**.

---

## (b) Purchase Tolerance

- Any portion of the **Contract Commitment Amount** may be delivered if the **minimum commitment** is satisfied.  
- The **maximum purchase amount** equals:
  > Contract Commitment Amount + the greater of **$100,000** or **5%** of that amount.  
- The Seller may increase a contract amount **up to the remaining balance of the Commitment Amount plus tolerance**.

## (c) Data Delivery Instructions

### (i) Mortgages Sold under the MultiLender Swap Program
For Mortgages delivered under MultiLender Swap, the following ULDD Data Points are required:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| **385** | `Loan Acquisition Scheduled UPB Amount` | — | UPB must reflect reductions for: <br>• Principal due through settlement month (even if uncollected) <br>• Advanced (prepaid) installments prior to settlement <br>• Any curtailments received on/before Delivery Date |
| **440** | `Last Paid Installment Due Date (DDLPI)` | — | For new Mortgages, enter the date **through which interest is scheduled to be paid**. <br>If prepaid interest exists, enter the date **through which prepaid interest applies**. |
| **368** | `Investor Feature Identifier` | **J99** | Required for **Green MBS** — Mortgages secured by properties with **HERS** or **ENERGY STAR** certifications (see Section 6202.3(f)). |

---

### (ii) Mortgages with Lender Crediting Borrower Interest at Closing
If a lender credits Borrower interest at closing (covering the first day of the month through the day before the Note Date):
- The Borrower’s **first P&I payment** is due **the first day of the month following closing**.  
- The Seller represents and warrants that such credit was applied.  
- Seller must deliver:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| **440** | `Last Paid Installment Due Date (DDLPI)` | — | For fixed-rate Mortgages, enter **Note Date** or **first day of closing month**. |

---

## (d) Minimum Commitment Amount
The **minimum commitment** under the MultiLender Swap Program is **$1,000**.

---

## (e) Security Wire Instructions
- Required for all **MultiLender pools**.  
- See:
  - Section **2201.1** — Certificate of Incumbency requirements  
  - Section **6205.3(c)** — security wire instructions  
  - Section **2403.11** — authorized Loan Selling Advisor® users, user roles, and submission form requirements

---

## (f) Settlement Cycle of Less than Five Days
For MultiLender Swap deliveries with a **Settlement Cycle < 5 days**:
- The **Document Custodian** must **certify the Mortgages** in **Loan Selling Advisor® by 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time** on the **Final Delivery Date**.  
- Certification must comply with Section **6301.8(a)** timing and delivery completion standards.

---

## Practical Meaning
This section defines Freddie Mac’s operational standards for **multi-seller pooled deliveries**:
- Establishes clear delivery and tolerance thresholds,  
- Aligns UPB and DDLPI reporting with settlement data,  
- Ensures energy-efficient loans are correctly flagged,  
- Enforces custodial certification timing for fast settlements.

Frequent Freddie compliance flags tied to this section:
> “UPB not reduced for curtailments,”  
> “DDLPI missing for prepaid interest,”  
> “Tolerance exceeded (>5%),”  
> “Green MBS IFI not reported,”  
> “Custodian missed 8 p.m. ET certification.”
