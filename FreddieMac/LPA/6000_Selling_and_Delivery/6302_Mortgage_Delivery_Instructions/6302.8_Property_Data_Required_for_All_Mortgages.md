## QC/Validation Tips
- Address: ensure USPS state code (18) and ZIP (16) format.  
- Year Built (67): use `9999` only when HVE or appraisal waiver; otherwise actual year.  
- SFHA (24) logic must respect detached non-residential-only exception.  
- Appraisal Identifier (82) required for **conventional** loans with appraisal → UCDP Doc File ID.  
- ADU income IFI `J66` only when rental income from ADU on a **Primary Residence**.  
- Bedroom/Rent per-unit arrays for 2–4 units must align with **Financed Unit Count (57)**.
