> The structure is cumulative — the Seller must deliver all applicable datasets (program, product, property, borrower, and special attributes).

---

### Investor Feature Identifiers (IFIs)
Where applicable, delivery must include **Investor Feature Identifiers (IFIs)** to flag special loan features.  
See **Exhibit 34 – Investor Feature Identifiers** for the complete list.

---

## (c) Relationship to Appendix A
- Appendix A provides XML-level definitions, valid enumerations, and Freddie Mac implementation notes.  
- This chapter mirrors those requirements but reorganizes them **by loan characteristics** rather than Sort ID.  
- Sellers must always cross-check with **Appendix A** and the **ULDD Addendum** for final authoritative values and conditions.

---

## (d) Other Delivery Instructions

### 1️⃣ Eligible Delivery Programs
If not otherwise limited, the Mortgage Product is eligible under **all programs**.  
When specified:
- **Cash** → Fixed-rate or ARM Cash  
- **Guarantor** → Fixed-rate or WAC ARM Guarantor  
- **MultiLender Swap** → MultiLender Swap program  

### 2️⃣ Pooling Information
Pooling rules for loans with unique characteristics appear in **Section 6302.12+**.  
If not listed, refer to:
- **Chapter 6202** for fixed-rate Guarantor or MultiLender Swap pooling,  
- **Chapter 6204** for WAC ARM Guarantor pooling.

### 3️⃣ Modified Mortgages
- **Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages** → Section **6302.27**  
- **Construction Conversion / Renovation** → Section **6302.28(b)(iv)**  
- Deliver modification data under the **“Modification”** tab in Loan Selling Advisor, and pre-modification data under the **“Closing”** tab.

---

## (e) Seller Warranties — Data Accuracy
By delivering data to Freddie Mac, the Seller **warrants** that:
- All data is **true, complete, and accurate**.  
- Errors or omissions discovered before purchase → **loan rejection**.  
- Errors found after purchase → **repurchase obligation** and potential enforcement under Purchase Documents.

---

## Practical Meaning
This section defines how Freddie Mac expects Sellers to structure, phase, and validate data in MISMO v3.0 format using ULDD standards.  
It’s the **core compliance anchor** for every loan delivery, ensuring Freddie can seamlessly pool and securitize loans.

Common Freddie Mac conditions referencing this rule:
> “ULDD Phase mismatch,”  
> “Invalid IFI enumeration,”  
> “XML schema validation failed,”  
> “Data inconsistency between Appendix A and loan file.”
