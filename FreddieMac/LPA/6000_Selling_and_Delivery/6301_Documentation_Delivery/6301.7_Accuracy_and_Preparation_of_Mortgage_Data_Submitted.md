Section: 6301.7 ‚Äì Accuracy and Preparation of Mortgage Data Submitted  
Effective Date: 03/02/2016  

> **Condition-Relevant Section ‚Äî Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6301.7 defines the Seller‚Äôs responsibility for the **accuracy, completeness, and timeliness** of all Mortgage data delivered to Freddie Mac.  
Any discrepancies between reported data and the underlying loan file or servicing records can lead to **rejection or repurchase** of the affected loan.

---

## Key Requirements

### 1Ô∏è‚É£  Data Accuracy Warranty
- The Seller **warrants** that all Mortgage data submitted to Freddie Mac are:
  - **True**
  - **Complete**
  - **Accurate**

> üîπ If errors or omissions are found **before purchase** ‚Üí Freddie Mac may **reject** the loan.  
> üîπ If found **after purchase** ‚Üí Freddie Mac may **require repurchase** of the affected Mortgage(s).

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£  Data Consistency
- **Essential accounting data** for each loan must match:
  - The **underlying loan documents**, and  
  - The Seller‚Äôs **individual mortgagor accounting records**.

- Freddie Mac purchases the loan based on **balances recorded in the Seller‚Äôs own Mortgage accounts**, not external summaries or unverified data.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£  Data Currency
- Loan records must be **updated within 10 days** before the delivery of Mortgage documents to Freddie Mac.  
  (Reference: *Directory 8* for operational timelines.)

- The Seller must use:
  - The most recent **Mortgage trial balance**, or  
  - Updated internal records showing the **UPB (Unpaid Principal Balance)** and related data.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£  Delinquency Determination
- When providing balances, Sellers must not assume payments have been made unless confirmed.  
- If a payment due **on or before** the date balances were taken remains unpaid, it is **considered delinquent**.

**Example:**  
If payment due on the 1st is still unpaid on the 2nd, it must be reported as **delinquent** for Freddie Mac purposes.

---

## Practical Meaning
This section enforces **data integrity prior to loan delivery**.  
Before funding or pooling, processors must ensure:
- All borrower data, UPB, interest, escrow, and status fields are correct.  
- Records are **less than 10 days old**.  
- No unpaid installments are falsely marked as current.  

> Failure to meet these requirements leads to Freddie Mac‚Äôs most common repurchase trigger ‚Äî *‚ÄúData mismatch between Note, file, and delivery tape.‚Äù*
