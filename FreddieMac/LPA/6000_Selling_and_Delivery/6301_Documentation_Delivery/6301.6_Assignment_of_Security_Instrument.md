Section: 6301.6 – Assignment of Security Instrument  
Effective Date: 09/10/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6301.6 governs how the **Security Instrument (Deed of Trust or Mortgage)** must be assigned and recorded when a loan is sold to Freddie Mac.  
It defines when **assignments to Freddie Mac or MERS** are required, and what actions are necessary during **Servicing Transfers**.  

The goal is to maintain a **complete, recorded chain of assignments** ensuring Freddie Mac’s first-lien interest is perfected and enforceable.

---

## Key Requirements

### 1️⃣  General Rule
- The Seller/Servicer is **not required** to prepare or record an assignment to Freddie Mac, unless Freddie Mac specifically directs them to do so.
- If Freddie Mac requests such assignment:
  - The Seller/Servicer must **prepare, execute, and record** it **at their own expense**.
- Any “**without recourse**” clause in the assignment does **not** remove the Seller/Servicer’s **repurchase obligations**.
- For **Freddie Mac’s transfer of ownership** to another party, the Seller/Servicer must prepare and record the required assignments **to Freddie Mac’s designee**.

> **Note:** Special Manufactured Home assignment rules are in **Sections 5703.4(b)** and **5703.4(f)(iii)**.  
> Mortgages secured by Manufactured Homes in *certificate-of-title* States (without surrender/cancellation provisions) **cannot be registered with MERS®.**

---

### 2️⃣  Mortgages Not Registered with MERS
- The Seller/Servicer must ensure:
  - The **chain of assignments** is **complete and recorded** from the original mortgagee to the Seller.
- For Servicing Transfers:
  - If a **Concurrent or Subsequent Transfer of Servicing** occurs, an **assignment to the Transferee Servicer** must be completed and recorded (as required by state law).
- If a state **does not accept assignments for recordation**, Seller must maintain an **affidavit** stating that fact with the unrecorded assignment.

---

### 3️⃣  Mortgages Registered with MERS (Post-Origination)
If MERS is **not** the original mortgagee of record:
- Seller/Servicer must:
  - Prepare, execute, and record an **assignment to MERS**, naming it as nominee for the lender and successors.
  - Maintain a **complete, recorded chain of assignments** to MERS.
- Exceptions:
  - **Montana, Oregon, and Washington** — Mortgages assigned to MERS *after origination* are **not eligible** for sale to Freddie Mac.
- If Servicing is transferred:
  - No new assignment needed if the Transferee Servicer **is a MERS Member**.
  - If not a MERS Member, follow the **non-MERS assignment procedures** in 6301.6(a).

---

### 4️⃣  Mortgages Originated with MERS as Mortgagee of Record
No assignments are required if:
- The Mortgage is originated naming MERS as the **original mortgagee of record**, solely as nominee for the lender, and  
- The Security Instrument was **properly executed, acknowledged, delivered, and recorded** to perfect a **first-lien** interest in favor of MERS.

---

### 5️⃣  Concurrent Transfers of Servicing

#### If Mortgage is Registered with MERS
- If the **Transferee Servicer is not a MERS Member**, apply the **non-MERS assignment rules**.
- Seller must:
  - Notify MERS of the Transfer and **update the MERS System**.
  - Ensure the Transferee Servicer follows **custodial procedures (Section 7101.4(c))**, and  
    delivers assignments to the **Transferee Document Custodian** for verification and certification (Section 6304.2).  
- The Transferee Servicer must also provide documentation confirming whether it retains all MERS assignments in its own Mortgage files.

#### If Mortgage is Not Registered with MERS
- Seller must:
  - Record all **intervening assignments** completing the chain to Seller.
  - Prepare and record **assignment to Transferee Servicer**.
- Transferee Servicer must:
  - Follow **Section 7101.4(c)** for custodial delivery, and  
  - Ensure verification and certification under **Section 6304.2**.

> Special Manufactured Home assignment rules apply (Sections 5703.4(b) and 5703.4(f)(iii)).

---

## Practical Meaning
Loan processors and post-closing teams must verify:
- Whether loan was registered with **MERS** at origination or later.  
- That **assignment chains** are complete and recorded up to the current Seller.  
- That all **intervening assignments** exist (no gaps).  
- That MERS membership status of the Transferee Servicer is reflected in the MERS System.  

Missing or incomplete assignments often trigger Freddie Mac conditions such as:  
> “Missing recorded assignment,” “Incomplete assignment chain,” or “MERS transfer not reflected.”
