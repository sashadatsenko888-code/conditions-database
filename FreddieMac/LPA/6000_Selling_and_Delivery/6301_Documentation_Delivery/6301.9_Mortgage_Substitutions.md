Section: 6301.9 – Mortgage Substitutions  
Effective Date: 03/02/2016  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6301.9 defines the procedures for **substituting one Mortgage for another** that has already been delivered to Freddie Mac, whether the substitution is initiated by the **Seller** or **required by Freddie Mac**.

This process ensures Freddie Mac’s contractual and balance requirements remain satisfied while allowing correction of prior delivery errors, ineligible loans, or document defects.

## Key Requirements

### 1️⃣  Submission of Documents
When a Seller substitutes a Mortgage:
- All documentation required under **Section 6301.8 (Completion of Delivery)** must also be submitted for the **substitute Mortgage**.
- This includes:
  - The original **Note** and endorsement per 6301.3,  
  - Required **assignments** under 6301.6,  
  - Any **modifications, addenda, or POAs**, and  
  - Proper **Custodian certification** (Form 1034E or equivalent).

> Substitution is treated as a **new delivery** for all documentation and certification purposes.

---

### 2️⃣  Retrieval of Original Mortgage Documents
Once Freddie Mac confirms acceptance of the substitute Mortgage:
- The Seller/Servicer may retrieve the **Note and related collateral documents** for the original Mortgage from the **Document Custodian**,  
  following the procedures in **Section 8107.2(c)** (Custodian release).

---

### 3️⃣  Freddie Mac–Required Substitutions
If Freddie Mac itself **requires a substitution**, the Seller must:
- Deliver a **replacement Mortgage** that meets all Purchase Document requirements.
- Ensure the substitute loan’s **outstanding principal balance (UPB)** satisfies the **contract commitment amount**.
- Deliver the substitute Mortgage by the **contract Due Date**.

If the substitute loan has a **different Note Rate**, it must remain within the **Note Rate range** established for that contract.

---

### 4️⃣  Contract Adjustments
If a substitution changes the commitment amount:
- The Seller must execute a **contract change request** to modify the commitment.  
- Freddie Mac may assess a **contract change fee** at its discretion.
- The Seller must pay Freddie Mac any **differential in UPB** between the original and substitute loans.

---

## Practical Meaning
This section governs correction workflows when:
- An ineligible or defective loan must be swapped out after delivery.
- Freddie Mac demands substitution to protect pool integrity or balance.
- The Seller wishes to realign commitment balances before funding.

In such cases, Freddie Mac treats the new loan as a fresh delivery requiring **full document compliance and custodian certification**.

Common Freddie Mac conditions linked to this rule:
> “Substitution documentation missing,”  
> “UPB differential unpaid,”  
> “Replacement loan not within rate range,”  
> “Custodian release pending prior Note.”
