Section: 6301.5 – Modifying Instrument or Assumption of Indebtedness Agreement  
Effective Date: 03/02/2016  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6301.5 specifies the **required supporting documents** that must be delivered **together with the original Note** whenever a Mortgage has been **modified, converted, or assumed**.  
These requirements ensure Freddie Mac has complete legal documentation reflecting the **current loan terms** and **borrower obligations**.

---

## Key Requirements

### 1️⃣  Modified or Converted Mortgages
If a Mortgage has been **modified** or **converted from ARM to fixed-rate**:
- Deliver the **original modification or conversion agreement** with the Note,  
  **unless** the agreement was recorded with the Security Instrument.
- If the modification/conversion agreement **was recorded**, deliver a **copy** instead of the original.

### 2️⃣  Construction Conversion or Renovation Mortgages
If the loan is a **Construction Conversion Mortgage** or **Renovation Mortgage** using **Modification Construction Conversion Documentation**:
- Deliver the **original Construction Conversion Modification Agreement** with the Note,  
  unless it was recorded with the Security Instrument.
- If recorded, deliver a **copy** of that agreement.

### 3️⃣  Ownership Transfer or Assumption
If the **ownership of the Mortgaged Premises** has been transferred:
- Deliver both:
  - The **ownership transfer instrument**, and  
  - The **assumption of indebtedness agreement**.

### 4️⃣  Temporary Modifications
If the modification agreement states that it **ceases to be effective upon purchase** of the Mortgage by Freddie Mac,  
→ **No delivery is required** for that modifying instrument.

---

## Practical Meaning
This section ensures that Freddie Mac receives all documents establishing the **current enforceable loan terms** and the **legal borrower** at the time of sale.  
Missing modification or assumption agreements commonly trigger post-purchase conditions such as:  
> “Missing modification agreement” or “Missing assumption package.”

Loan processors should:
- Verify whether any **modifications, assumptions, or transfers** occurred pre-sale,  
- Ensure the correct **originals or recorded copies** are provided with the Note,  
- Confirm that **temporary mods** (e.g., trial period plans) are excluded if they expire upon purchase.
