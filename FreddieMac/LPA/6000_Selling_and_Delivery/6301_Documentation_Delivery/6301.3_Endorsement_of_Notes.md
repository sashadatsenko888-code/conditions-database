Section: 6301.3 – Endorsement of Notes  
Effective Date: 08/19/2020  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s **requirements for endorsement of promissory Notes** when a Mortgage is sold.  
Every original Note must be properly endorsed by the Seller’s authorized representative, ensuring **negotiability** and clear **chain of title** to Freddie Mac.

The section differentiates between:
- Notes **without recourse** (most standard sales),  
- Notes **with recourse** (special Guarantor or MultiLender Swap contracts),  
- Rules for **facsimile signatures**, and  
- Rules for **using an Allonge**.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Endorsement “Without Recourse”
- Applies to all Mortgages **not sold with recourse**.  
- The Note must bear this endorsement:  
PAY TO THE ORDER OF __________________________
WITHOUT RECOURSE
(Name of Seller-endorser)
(Signature of duly authorized representative)
(Typed name and title)
- Must be signed by a **duly authorized officer** (not via Power of Attorney).  
- The “without recourse” phrase does **not remove repurchase obligations** under Purchase Documents.

### (b) Endorsement “With Recourse”
- Used only for loans sold **with recourse** (per Section 6201.7(a)).  
- Endorsement omits “without recourse” but otherwise follows the same structure and authorization requirements.

### (c) Chain of Endorsement
- Must be **complete from the original payee to the Seller**.  
- Seller must endorse the Note in blank when selling to Freddie Mac.  
- Seller is responsible for the **validity and negotiability** of all endorsements.  
- **Document Custodian may not endorse** the Note.  
- When Servicing is transferred, the **Transferor Servicer cannot complete** or add endorsements.  
- **eNotes** are exempt (they’re handled under UETA and E-SIGN rules).

### (d) Facsimile Signature
- Permitted only if:
- The printed signature is of an authorized corporate officer.  
- The officer provides an **affidavit authenticating** the signature stamp.  
- The Seller’s counsel issues a **legal opinion** confirming its validity.  
- Freddie Mac may request copies of both the affidavit and opinion.

### (e) Allonge Usage
- Allowed if:
- The **Allonge is permanently affixed** to the Note.  
- It includes borrower name, property address, and original loan amount.  
- It complies with applicable laws and **preserves Freddie Mac’s holder-in-due-course status**.

---

## Practical Meaning
This section is a frequent **closing or post-closing condition**:
- Missing or incorrect endorsements delay loan purchase.  
- Custodian will flag “Note not properly endorsed” or “Allonge not affixed.”  
- For eNotes, this section confirms **no physical endorsement required**, avoiding false conditions.
