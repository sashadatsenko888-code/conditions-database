Section: 6301.2 – Pledged Mortgage Delivery  
Effective Date: 09/10/2018  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6301.2 specifies that all **Pledged Mortgages** — i.e., loans pledged as collateral to a Warehouse Lender — must be delivered in accordance with Freddie Mac’s pledged-loan procedures.  
These requirements are detailed in **Section 6302.38** (loan delivery requirements for pledged mortgages) and **Chapter 6305** (warehouse and collateral release procedures).  
For electronic pledged loans (**Pledged eMortgages**), reference is made to **Section 1402.16**.

---

## Key Requirements
- **Delivery compliance:** Pledged Mortgages must follow the delivery standards outlined in Section 6302.38 and Chapter 6305.  
- **Electronic format:** For eMortgages that are pledged, Section 1402.16 governs their handling and release.  
- **Custodial oversight:** Delivery must satisfy both Freddie Mac and warehouse lender documentation controls before funding.  

---

## Practical Meaning
This section covers **pledged loans held on warehouse lines** before sale to Freddie Mac.  
Loan processors and post-closing teams must ensure warehouse release forms (e.g., Form 996E) and pledge documentation are delivered as required.  
Failure to meet these delivery requirements can delay funding or cause Freddie Mac to reject the purchase.
