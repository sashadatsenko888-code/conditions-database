Section: 6301.11 – Postsettlement Purchase Adjustments  
Effective Date: 03/02/2016  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6301.11 establishes Freddie Mac’s policy on **postsettlement purchase adjustments**, clarifying that once settlement has occurred and Mortgages have been pooled, the **purchase balances are final** and cannot generally be changed.  
Only in rare, pre-pooling cases can a Seller request an adjustment.

---

## Key Requirements

### 1️⃣  General Rule
- **After settlement**, purchase balances **cannot be adjusted** because the loans are already **pooled for resale**.  
- Pooling finalizes Freddie Mac’s ownership position, and any post-purchase balance change would affect issued securities — therefore prohibited.

---

### 2️⃣  Limited Exception — Before Pooling
If **settlement has occurred but pooling has not yet taken place**, Freddie Mac **may permit** a purchase balance adjustment.  
Such adjustments are rare and must be initiated **immediately**.

- Seller must **contact Freddie Mac at 800-FREDDIE** as soon as the discrepancy is detected and **before funding** if possible.  
- After funding, all balance inquiries must be directed to the **Seller’s Freddie Mac accounting representative** (see Directory 8).

---

## Practical Meaning
This section reinforces finality of settlement:
- Once Freddie Mac funds the purchase and pools the loan, **no further monetary corrections** can be processed.  
- Only pre-pooling errors (e.g., rounding discrepancies, interest miscalculations, or duplicate funding) may be reviewed case-by-case.  

Typical Freddie audit comments linked to this section:
> “Purchase balance mismatch — after pooling (non-adjustable),”  
> “Contacted Freddie postsettlement — adjustment denied,”  
> “Incorrect UPB reported — final after security issuance.”
