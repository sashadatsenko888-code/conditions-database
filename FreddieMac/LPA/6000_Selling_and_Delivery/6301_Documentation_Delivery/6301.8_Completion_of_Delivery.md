Section: 6301.8 – Completion of Delivery  
Effective Date: 09/10/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6301.8 defines when **delivery to Freddie Mac is considered complete** and what documentation must be provided and certified by the **Document Custodian**.  
Settlement cannot occur until delivery is fully completed and accepted.  

This section ties together all preceding delivery requirements — Notes, Assignments, Modifications, MERS data, and Custodian certification — forming the **final compliance checkpoint before settlement**.

---

## Key Requirements

### 1️⃣  Definition of “Complete Delivery”
Delivery is complete only when **both** of the following occur:

1. **Freddie Mac has received and accepted**:
   - All required loan data, documentation, and information defined by the Purchase Documents.  
   - For **MERS-registered loans**, the Seller/Servicer must:
     - Register the Mortgage with MERS **before** delivery to Freddie Mac.  
     - Provide the **Mortgage Identification Number (MIN)** at the time of delivery.  
     - Indicate the MIN on the **Security Instrument** and all related documents.  
       (Applies regardless of whether documents are retained or sent to Custodian.)

2. **The Document Custodian has received and certified**:
   - The original **Note**, properly endorsed per Section 6301.3.  
   - The **Custodial Certification Schedule (Form 1034E)** or **Note Delivery Cover Sheet** via Loan Selling Advisor®.  
   - All other original or certified documents required under this section.

> Freddie Mac may require the **Freddie Mac loan number** to be affixed on the face of each Note (at Seller’s expense).

---

### 2️⃣  Settlement Conditions
- Freddie Mac will **not settle** until delivery is complete and certified.  
- If the Seller fails to complete delivery by **8:00 PM ET** the day before Settlement Date, Freddie Mac may:
  - **Cancel** or **postpone** settlement or funding at its discretion.  
  - Recover any resulting losses or legal expenses from the Seller.

> See Section 6401.1 for *pair-off* requirements related to canceled Cash contracts.

---

### 3️⃣  Indemnification
The Seller indemnifies and holds Freddie Mac harmless against:
- Any losses, damages, claims, or suits arising from Freddie Mac’s **cancellation or postponement** of settlement or funding due to incomplete delivery.

---

### 4️⃣  Delivery and Certification Requirements
In addition to compliance with **Sections 2202.2, 2202.3, 6304.2, and 6304.3**, the following must be delivered to and certified by the Document Custodian:

#### Mandatory Documentation
- **Form 1034E** or **Note Delivery Cover Sheet** (via Loan Selling Advisor)  
- **Original Note** (endorsed per 6301.3) and any **modifying instruments or addenda**  
- Evidence if the loan was **closed with MERS as original mortgagee of record**  
- **Original assignments** of Security Instruments (per 6301.6)  
  - Unless MERS-registered and Seller elected to retain assignments in the loan file  

#### Special Document Handling
If **recorded assignments** are still pending:
- Deliver a **certified copy** of the sent-for-recordation assignment to the Custodian.  
- Deliver the **original recorded version** immediately once received.  
- If recordation is not accepted in the jurisdiction, include an **affidavit** noting this fact.

#### Other Possible Required Documents
- **Form 3180 – Agreement to Convert**  
- **Original assumption agreement**  
- **Original addenda**  
- **Original or certified POA** (if sent for recordation)  
- **Form 5161 – Multistate Loan Modification Agreement (to Fixed Rate)**  
- **Form 3172 – NY CEMA** (per 4101.11)  
- **Construction Conversion Modification Agreement** (original or certified copy)  
- Any other documentation Freddie Mac may require at its discretion.

#### For Pledged Mortgages
Freddie Mac’s Mortgage Purchase Department must also receive all forms required by **Sections 6305.3, 6305.4, and 6305.5**, plus any additional documents Freddie Mac requests.

---

### 5️⃣  Post-Settlement Tracking
- The Seller must enter and associate all **Freddie Mac loan numbers** within its servicing system immediately before or after settlement.  
- If Servicing is transferred concurrently:
  - The **Transferee Servicer** must also associate Freddie Mac loan numbers in its system.  
  - This ensures accurate **tracking, certification, and servicing** for all loans.

- The Seller, Servicer, and Document Custodian — including successors and transferees — remain **jointly responsible** for the ongoing **delivery, certification, and tracking** of all Notes.

---

## Practical Meaning
This section ensures the loan’s **collateral package is fully documented, traceable, and certified** before Freddie Mac wires funds or issues securities.  
Missing or uncertified documents (especially Notes, Assignments, or MERS confirmations) are among the most frequent post-purchase conditions flagged by Freddie Mac.

Typical post-purchase exceptions include:
> “Note not certified,”  
> “Assignment not received,”  
> “Missing NY CEMA or Modification Agreement,”  
> “Incomplete MERS registration.”
