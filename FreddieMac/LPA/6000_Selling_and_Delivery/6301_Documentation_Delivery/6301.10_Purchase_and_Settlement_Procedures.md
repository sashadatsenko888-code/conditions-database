> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6301.10 governs the **final funding and settlement process** for Mortgages purchased by Freddie Mac.  
It specifies how Freddie Mac issues payment, which forms are generated, and the account and authorization standards required for all wire transfers.

---

## Key Requirements

### 1️⃣  Preparation of Form 15/A/C (Loan Purchase Statement)
After Freddie Mac reviews and validates all submitted Mortgages, it generates a **Loan Purchase Statement** summarizing:

- Key loan data and purchase details  
- Computation of the total **funds due to the Seller**  

Depending on the **type of sale**, Freddie Mac will issue:

| Type of Purchase | Form Used | Description |
|------------------|------------|--------------|
| Cash Sale | **Loan Purchase Statement (Form 15)** | For standard loan purchases |
| Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program | **Form 15A** | For fixed-rate Guarantor contracts |
| WAC ARM Guarantor Program | **Form 15C** | For WAC ARM Guarantor contracts |

> These forms serve as Freddie Mac’s official settlement statement — confirming loan acceptance, pricing, and funding totals.

---

### 2️⃣  Wire Transfers

#### (a) Eligible Accounts
All wire transfers related to the purchase of Mortgages must be made **only** to the Seller’s own account held at an eligible financial institution, such as:

- A **Federal Home Loan Bank**,  
- A **commercial bank**, or  
- A **Federal Reserve Bank**.

> Freddie Mac will **not** wire funds to a Servicing Agent’s account.

#### (b) Federal Reserve Accounts
If the Seller’s account is at a **Federal Reserve Bank**, it may be used for:
- Clearing checks, or  
- Receiving and disbursing Freddie Mac wire transfers.  

Before instructing Freddie Mac to wire funds to a Federal Reserve Bank account, the Seller must confirm:
1. The account is **eligible** to receive direct wire transfers.  
2. Freddie Mac has on file an **approved Certificate of Incumbency**, as described below.

#### (c) Authorized Personnel and Certificates of Incumbency
The Seller must have submitted one of the following, as applicable:

| Entity Type | Required Form | Description |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Bank, Savings Bank, Credit Union, Corporation, or LLC | **Form 988SF** | Certificate of Incumbency identifying employees authorized to provide or modify wire transfer instructions |
| Limited Partnership | **Form 989SF** | Equivalent authorization for partnerships |

Only individuals designated in these forms may authorize Freddie Mac to transfer or modify wire instructions on behalf of the Seller.

#### (d) Warehouse Lenders
For loans financed under warehouse credit arrangements:
- Wire transfer procedures must also comply with **Chapter 6305** (Warehouse Lender financing and releases).

---

## Practical Meaning
This section establishes **final settlement controls** to prevent fraud, ensure correct payment routing, and maintain compliance with Freddie Mac’s purchase procedures.

Frequent Freddie conditions tied to this rule include:
> “Incorrect wire account or name mismatch,”  
> “Missing Certificate of Incumbency,”  
> “Funds wired to servicing agent instead of lender,”  
> “Warehouse wire form incomplete.”
