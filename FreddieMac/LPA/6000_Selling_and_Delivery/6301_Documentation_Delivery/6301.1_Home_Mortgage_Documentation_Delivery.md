Section: 6301.1 – Home Mortgage Documentation Delivery  
Effective Date: 03/02/2016  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
Section 6301.1 defines the Seller’s obligation to **deliver all required Home Mortgage documentation** to Freddie Mac (or its designated custodian) **within the time period required by the applicable purchase program** and **at the Seller’s own expense**.  
All documents must be submitted in the **proper form** and **executed as required** under Freddie Mac’s Purchase Documents.

---

## Key Requirements
- **Responsibility:** Seller bears full cost and responsibility for preparing and delivering all mortgage documentation to Freddie Mac.  
- **Timing:** Delivery must occur **within the time frame** specified in the applicable purchase program.  
- **Approval:** All documentation is subject to **Freddie Mac’s review and approval** for correct form and execution.  
- **Processing Lead Time:** Sellers are advised to allow a reasonable processing and review period **prior to the Funding or Settlement Date.**  
- **Purchase Price Adjustment:** Freddie Mac adjusts the purchase price based on **interest accrued through the day before** the Funding or Settlement Date.

---

## Practical Meaning
This section underpins every “document delivery” condition on a loan file — i.e., when the lender requires submission of fully executed Notes, Security Instruments, riders, or disclosures before funding.  
Delays or errors in document delivery can cause purchase delays, post-settlement adjustments, or repurchase triggers.
