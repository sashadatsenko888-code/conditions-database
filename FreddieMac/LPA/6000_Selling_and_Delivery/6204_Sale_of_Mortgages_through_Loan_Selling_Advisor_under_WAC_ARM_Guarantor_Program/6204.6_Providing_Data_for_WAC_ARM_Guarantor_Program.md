Section: 6204.6 – Providing Data for Mortgages Sold through Loan Selling Advisor® under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program  
Effective Date: 12/11/2017  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section specifies how Sellers must provide loan data for **Mortgages sold under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program** through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Data Submission Methods
The Seller must provide required data for all loans sold under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program using one of the following methods:

1. **Importing the required loan data directly** into **Loan Selling Advisor®**, or  
2. **Importing relevant Loan Product Advisor® (LPA) data**, using the associated **Key Number**, into Loan Selling Advisor, or  
3. **Manually entering** all loan-level data for each Mortgage directly into Loan Selling Advisor.

---

### (b) Loan Allocation
- After providing loan data, the Seller must **allocate those loans** to a valid **WAC ARM Guarantor Contract** in Loan Selling Advisor®.  
- Loan allocation ensures the proper linkage between each Mortgage and its associated contract for settlement, pooling, and disclosure purposes.

---

### (c) Loan Number Assignment
- Once the data is successfully imported and allocated, **Loan Selling Advisor® automatically assigns a unique Freddie Mac loan number** to each Mortgage sold under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program.  
- These Freddie Mac loan numbers are used for:
  - Post-settlement tracking  
  - Servicing transfers  
  - Pool-level reporting and disclosure  

---

## Practical Meaning
- Sellers can submit data automatically via import or manually.  
- Proper allocation to a WAC ARM Guarantor Contract is required for Freddie Mac to purchase and securitize the loans.  
- The system ensures consistent loan tracking via automated Freddie Mac loan number assignment.
