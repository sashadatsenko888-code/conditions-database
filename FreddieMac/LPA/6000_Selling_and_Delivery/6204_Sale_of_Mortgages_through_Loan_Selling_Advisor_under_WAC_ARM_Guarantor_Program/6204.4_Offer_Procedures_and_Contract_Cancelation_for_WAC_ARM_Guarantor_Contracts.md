  - **Settlement Cycle**.

---

- The Seller must select one of the following **Settlement Cycles**:
  - **2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-day** Settlement Cycle; or  
  - **6–15-day** Settlement Cycle for **early pool disclosure**.

---

### (c) Settlement Date Changes
- **Permitted**: Seller may change the Settlement Date **only if the Settlement Cycle has not commenced**.  
  - The new Settlement Date must still fall on or before the latest Settlement Date associated with the applicable Pricing Identifier.  
  - The Final Delivery Date may also be changed.  
- **Not permitted**: Once the Settlement Cycle has commenced, the Settlement Date **cannot be changed**.

---

### (d) Early Pool Disclosure (6–15-Day Cycle)
- If the Settlement Cycle has commenced, Mortgages may be **removed** from the early pool disclosure contract **only if:**
  - The Mortgages have been **paid off**, and  
  - The removal occurs **48 hours prior to the Settlement Date**.  
- Seller must continue to comply with **Chapter 6202** pooling requirements.  
- To remove a Mortgage, the Seller must contact **Customer Service at 800-FREDDIE**.

---

### (e) Gold Rush® Fees
If the Seller selects a **2-, 3-, or 4-day Settlement Cycle**, a **Gold Rush® fee** will apply, payable per **Section 6303.2(a)**.

**Gold Rush Fee Characteristics:**
- Expressed in **basis points**  
- Applied to the **aggregate unpaid principal balance (UPB)** of Mortgages in the contract  
- **Subject to monthly updates**  
- Displayed in Loan Selling Advisor® under the **Credit Fees** section of the **Guarantor Rate Sheet**

---

### (f) Minimum Aggregate UPB
- Each WAC ARM Guarantor Contract must have **an aggregate UPB of at least $500,000**.  
- See **Section 6202.4** for detailed ARM pooling and UPB limitations.

---

### (g) Optional Delivery and Cancelation
- **Delivery is optional** under a WAC ARM Guarantor Contract.  
- The Seller may **cancel** a WAC ARM Guarantor Contract in Loan Selling Advisor® **until 8:00 p.m. Eastern time** on the **Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date**.

---

## Practical Meaning
- This section governs timing flexibility and fee implications when scheduling ARM pool settlements.  
- Sellers benefit from optional delivery and cancellation flexibility but must carefully manage cycle timing to avoid incurring Gold Rush fees or violating settlement requirements.
