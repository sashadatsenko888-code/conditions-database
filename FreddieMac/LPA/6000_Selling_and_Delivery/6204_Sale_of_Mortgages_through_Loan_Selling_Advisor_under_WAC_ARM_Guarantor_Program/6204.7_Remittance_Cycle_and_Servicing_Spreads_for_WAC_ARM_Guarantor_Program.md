Section: 6204.7 – Remittance Cycle and Servicing Spreads for Mortgages Sold through Loan Selling Advisor® under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program  
Effective Date: 05/01/2019  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section establishes the **remittance cycle** and **Servicing Spread requirements** for **Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)** sold under the **WAC ARM Guarantor Program** through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Remittance Cycle
- The **Standard Remittance Cycle** applies to all Mortgages sold under a **WAC ARM Guarantor Contract**.  
- All rules and requirements relating to remittance cycles and Servicing Spreads are governed by **Chapter 6201**, as amended or supplemented by this section or by Loan Selling Advisor®.  
- This ensures consistency in payment reporting and investor remittances across Freddie Mac ARM portfolios.

---

### (b) Servicing Spreads

#### Definition
In **Loan Selling Advisor®**, the term **Minimum Required Servicing Spread** is equivalent to **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread** as defined in the Freddie Mac Guide.

#### Range and Limits
- The **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread** for each ARM sold under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program:
  - **Must be at least 0.250%**
  - **May not exceed 2.00%**

#### Lender-Paid Mortgage Insurance (LPMI)
- For ARMs with **lender-paid mortgage insurance** (annual or monthly renewal premiums),  
  the **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread must include** the amount necessary to pay the **mortgage insurance premium when due**.

---

### (c) Discrete Servicing Spread Components
For ARMs sold under this program, the Seller must select **three discrete Minimum Contract Servicing Spreads**:

1. **Minimum Coupon Servicing Spread** –  
   Applies from purchase through the period when the Note Rate is limited by the **Initial Cap** or **Periodic Cap**.

2. **Minimum Margin Servicing Spread** –  
   Applies when the Note Rate equals the **Index + Margin**.

3. **Minimum Lifetime Ceiling Servicing Spread** –  
   Applies once the adjusted Note Rate reaches its **Lifetime Ceiling** and through the remaining loan term.

#### Variable Servicing Spreads
- The Seller may choose the **same or different values** for any of the three discrete spreads.  
- When different values are selected, the ARMs are classified as **variable servicing spread loans**.  
- These selections must comply with **Section 6201.3(c)**.

---

## Practical Meaning
- All ARMs under this program follow the **Standard Remittance Cycle**, aligning with fixed-rate Guarantor contracts.  
- Sellers define the **Servicing Spread structure** at contract creation — either fixed or variable — within permitted ranges.  
- This spread determines Servicer compensation and remittance flow to Freddie Mac.
