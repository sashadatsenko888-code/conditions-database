## Overview
This section defines the **Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)** products that are eligible for sale to **Freddie Mac** under the **WAC ARM Guarantor Program** through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

## Key Requirements

- Freddie Mac will purchase only those **ARM products** described in:  
  - **Section 4401.1** — ARM product definitions and structural features; and  
  - **Exhibit 17S** — *Available Mortgage Products* (official listing of approved ARM types).

- Eligibility includes ARMs with specific **rate adjustment structures** and **disclosure parameters** outlined in Section 4401.1 and summarized in Exhibit 17S.

---

### Reference Details
- **Initial Cap**, **Periodic Cap**, and **Life Cap** limits for ARMs sold under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program are governed by:  
  - **Section 4401.1(c)** — defines the maximum interest rate adjustment amounts per product type.  
- Sellers must review **Exhibit 17S** for current eligibility and coding instructions before submission.

---

## Practical Meaning
- Only ARM products explicitly approved by Freddie Mac (listed in Exhibit 17S) may be delivered under the **WAC ARM Guarantor Program**.  
- ARM terms must fully conform to Freddie Mac’s **cap structure requirements**—Initial, Periodic, and Life Caps—as specified in **Section 4401.1(c)**.  
- This ensures rate adjustment uniformity and accurate pooling for WAC ARM PCs.
