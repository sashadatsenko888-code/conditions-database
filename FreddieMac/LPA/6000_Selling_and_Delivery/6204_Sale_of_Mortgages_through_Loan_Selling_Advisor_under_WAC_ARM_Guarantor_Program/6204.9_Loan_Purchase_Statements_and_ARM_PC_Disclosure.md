Section: 6204.9 – Loan Purchase Statements and ARM PC Disclosure for Mortgages Sold through Loan Selling Advisor® under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program  
Effective Date: 12/05/2022  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section specifies how **Loan Purchase Statements (Form 15C)** and **ARM PC Pool Disclosures** are provided to Sellers under the **WAC ARM Guarantor Program**.  
It ensures that Sellers can access accurate documentation and disclosure data for all purchased ARM Pools via **Loan Selling Advisor®** and Freddie Mac’s public disclosure channels.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Loan Purchase Statement
- Freddie Mac makes **Form 15** (Loan Purchase Statement) — and specifically **Form 15C for WAC ARM PCs** — available to Sellers in **Loan Selling Advisor®**.  
- Form 15C is accessible by the **first day of the Settlement Cycle**.  
- For Sellers using a **6–15 day Settlement Cycle** who remove Mortgages from early pool disclosure (as permitted under **Section 6203.4**),  
  → an **updated Form 15C** must be accessed to reflect the final loan composition.

**Purpose:**  
Form 15C details the purchase confirmation and settlement data for each Mortgage included in the WAC ARM PC Pool.

---

### (b) Disclosure for ARM PCs Formed under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program
- For every Pool formed under this program, **Freddie Mac publishes a Pool Supplement** that includes detailed loan-level and pool-level disclosure data.  
- This supplement is available:
  - On Freddie Mac’s MBS disclosure website: [freddiemac.com/mbs](https://www.freddiemac.com/mbs/)  
  - Through a direct **link in Loan Selling Advisor®** connected to **Form 15C**  
  - Beginning on the **first day of the Settlement Cycle**

- The **Pool Supplement** contains:
  - Information about the Mortgages included in the WAC ARM PC Pool as of the **Settlement Date**  
  - Loan characteristics, aggregate pool data, and other securitization disclosures

- Sellers may also request a copy directly from **Investor Inquiry** at **(800) 336-3672**.

**Reference:**  
See **Section 6202.2** for additional details on Freddie Mac’s Pool Supplement structure and related investor disclosure materials.

---

## Practical Meaning
- Sellers must review **Form 15C** and the **Pool Supplement** to confirm accurate loan settlement and disclosure before or on the Settlement Date.  
- Early pool disclosure adjustments (under long Settlement Cycles) require the Seller to access the **updated Form 15C**.  
- Freddie Mac ensures transparency for all investors by publishing these disclosures on its public MBS site and in Loan Selling Advisor®.
