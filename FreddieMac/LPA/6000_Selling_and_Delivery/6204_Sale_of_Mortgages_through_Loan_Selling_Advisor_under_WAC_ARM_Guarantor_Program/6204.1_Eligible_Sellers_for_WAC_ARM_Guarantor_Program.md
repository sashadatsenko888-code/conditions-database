---

## Key Requirements
- To participate, the Seller must:

  2. Obtain access to the **WAC ARM Guarantor Program functionality** in **Loan Selling Advisor®** directly from Freddie Mac **before submitting offers**.  
  3. Ensure that such access is granted under Freddie Mac’s system authorization process described in **Section 2403.1**.
