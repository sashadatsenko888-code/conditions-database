## Overview
This section defines the **purchase requirements** for **Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)** sold to **Freddie Mac** under the **WAC ARM Guarantor Program** through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Eligible ARMs
ARMs eligible for sale under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program must:
- Be **non-convertible first-lien Mortgages**.  
- **Fully amortize** over the loan term.  
- Have an **original maturity not exceeding 30 years**.  
- Comply with all **eligibility requirements** described in **Chapter 4401**.

---

### (b) Margin and Pricing
Each eligible ARM must:
- Be sold in accordance with a valid **WAC ARM Guarantor Contract**.  
- Have a **Margin** that is **at least equal to** the sum of:
  - The **Credit Fee in Yield**, and  
  - The **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread**.  
- For ARMs with **lender-paid mortgage insurance** (annual or monthly premium):
  - The Minimum Contract Servicing Spread must include an amount sufficient to cover the **insurance premium** when due.  

---

### (c) Applicable Provisions
Unless otherwise stated in this chapter:
- The requirements of **Chapter 6201 (Guarantor Program)** apply to ARMs sold under the WAC ARM Guarantor Program.  
- The applicable **swap disclosure and pooling requirements** from **Chapter 6202** also apply.  

---

## Practical Meaning
- Only **fully amortizing, first-lien ARMs** with maturities ≤30 years qualify.  
- Margins must cover both Freddie Mac’s **Credit Fee in Yield** and the **Servicing Spread**, ensuring proper compensation for risk and servicing costs.  
- ARMs sold must meet the **same compliance, disclosure, and delivery standards** as fixed-rate loans under the Guarantor framework, with adjustments specific to ARMs.
