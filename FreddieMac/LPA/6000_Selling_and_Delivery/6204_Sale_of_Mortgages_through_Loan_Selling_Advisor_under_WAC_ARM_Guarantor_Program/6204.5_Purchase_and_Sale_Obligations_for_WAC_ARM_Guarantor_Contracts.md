Section: 6204.5 – Purchase and Sale Obligations and Commitment Amounts for WAC ARM Guarantor Contracts  
Effective Date: 12/11/2017  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines the **purchase and sale obligations** and **commitment monitoring requirements** for Sellers participating in the **WAC ARM Guarantor Program** through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Purchase and Sale Obligations
- A Seller **makes an offer to sell Mortgages to Freddie Mac** when it enters the required loan data into **Loan Selling Advisor®** to take out a **WAC ARM Guarantor Contract**.  
- A **binding contract** is created when the Seller **accepts the contract terms and conditions** presented by Freddie Mac in Loan Selling Advisor®.  
- Once accepted, both Freddie Mac and the Seller are legally bound by the **terms of the WAC ARM Guarantor Contract**, including settlement and delivery provisions.

---

### (b) Commitment Amounts
- The Seller must **monitor the aggregate unpaid principal balance (UPB)** of all Mortgages delivered to Freddie Mac under the same **Pricing Identifier Terms**.  
- The Seller must ensure that the **Commitment Amount tolerance** — the allowable variance between the contracted and delivered UPB — is **not exceeded**.  
- Exceeding the Commitment Amount tolerance may result in **contract modification, penalty, or rejection** of delivery by Freddie Mac.

---

## Practical Meaning
- The moment a Seller confirms a WAC ARM Guarantor Contract in Loan Selling Advisor®, it becomes a legally binding sales commitment.  
- The Seller must track the **total loan volume delivered** under that commitment to remain within Freddie Mac’s **UPB tolerance thresholds**.  
- Compliance ensures smooth settlement and prevents financial penalties or delays in security issuance.
