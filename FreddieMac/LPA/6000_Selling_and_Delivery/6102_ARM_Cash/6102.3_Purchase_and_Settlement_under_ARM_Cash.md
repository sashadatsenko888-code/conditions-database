Section: 6102.3 – Purchase and Settlement under ARM Cash  
Effective Date: 10/08/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines the **purchase and settlement procedures** applicable to Mortgages sold to Freddie Mac under the **ARM Cash Program**, including Funding Date requirements, payment calculations, and interest remittance to Servicers.

---

## (a) Funding Date

By the **close of business on the Purchase Contract Expiration Date**, the Seller must have:
- Completed **all requirements** for the sale of Mortgages to Freddie Mac, and  
- Delivered all required documentation for purchase and settlement.

### Funding Timing Options
- Sellers may **request a specific Funding Date** for each Mortgage, **or**  
- Elect **ASAP funding**, meaning Freddie Mac will fund as soon as practicable once all sale requirements have been met.

> All funding activity must occur no later than the business close of the Purchase Contract Expiration Date.

---

## (b) Funding Amount

For each Mortgage funded under an ARM Cash Contract, Freddie Mac pays the Seller:

\[
\text{Funding Amount} = \text{UPB} \times \text{Contract Price (adjusted for ARM Loan Attributes)}
\]

### Credit Fees
If a Mortgage is subject to **Credit Fees** or **credits for Credit Fees**:
- Freddie Mac will **net these amounts** against the funding payment, and  
- Any subsequent adjustments will be **reflected on the Seller’s monthly invoice**.

---

## (c) Interest Paid to the Servicer in Connection with Funding

Freddie Mac calculates interest to be paid to the Servicer as follows:

### 1. Pre-Funding Interest
Computed from the **first day of the Funding Date month** through the **day before the Funding Date**, using the **Accounting Net Yield (ANY)**.

### 2. Post-Funding Servicing Compensation
After funding:
- The Servicer retains an amount equal to the **Servicing Spread** for each ARM.  
- Freddie Mac authorizes the Servicer to **retain this spread** directly from Borrower payments.  
- The Servicer then **remits the ANY** to Freddie Mac.
