## Overview
This section defines Freddie Mac’s requirements for **ARM Cash** transactions — including key defined terms, eligibility criteria for Sellers, and Mortgage purchase requirements.  
It serves as the foundational guidance for all adjustable-rate Mortgages (ARMs) sold under **ARM Cash Contracts**.

---

## (a) ARM Cash Defined Terms

Sellers must understand the following key definitions:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Loan Attributes** | For ARMs sold under ARM Cash, the Note Rate, Margin, Servicing Spread, Life Cap, and Initial Period. |
| **Loan Level Tolerance** | The allowable range of values specified in the contract for the Loan Attributes of each ARM allocated to the contract. |

These parameters determine the eligibility of individual ARM loans under an ARM Cash Contract.

---

## (b) Eligible Sellers for ARM Cash

To sell Mortgages to Freddie Mac under ARM Cash:
- The **Seller must have executed a Purchase Contract** with Freddie Mac.  
- Freddie Mac reserves the right to impose additional margin and trading requirements.

### (i) Margin Requirements
Freddie Mac may, **at its sole discretion**, require Sellers to **post margin** for ARM Cash transactions.  
Freddie Mac acts as the **sole calculation agent** for:
- determining required margin, and  
- deciding whether such margin is to be posted or returned.

### (ii) Margin Deficit Notification
- If Freddie Mac notifies the Seller of a **margin deficit by 10:00 a.m. ET** on a Business Day, the Seller must transfer the required margin **by close of business the same day**.  
- If notice is received **after 10:00 a.m. ET** or on a **non-Business Day**, the margin must be transferred **by close of business on the next Business Day**.

### (iii) Establishing a Securities Trading Account
Sellers may establish a **trading account** with Freddie Mac to trade UMBS® and Mortgage Participation Certificates.

To request approval:
- Email: **CashDesk_Traders@FreddieMac.com**  
- Phone: **(571) 382-3080**

Trading activity is governed by:
- **Exhibit 102 – Securities Trading Customer Agreement**, and  
- Freddie Mac’s role as **calculation agent** for all margin-related amounts (final and binding determinations).

## (c) Eligible Mortgages and Purchase Requirements under ARM Cash

### (i) Mortgage Variability under ARM Cash
Within a single ARM Cash Contract, Sellers may deliver ARMs with **Note Rates, Margins, Life Caps, Servicing Spreads, and Initial Periods** that vary **within the range (Loan Level Tolerance)** defined in the contract.

### (ii) Accounting Net Yield (ANY)
For each ARM delivered under ARM Cash, Freddie Mac calculates an **Accounting Net Yield (ANY)** based on:
- the individual ARM’s **Note Rate**, and  
- the **Servicing Spread**.

### (iii) Special Eligibility Requirements
Unless stated otherwise in Chapter 6102, all **ARM eligibility requirements** in **Chapter 4401** apply to Mortgages sold under ARM Cash.

### (iv) Related Guide Provisions
