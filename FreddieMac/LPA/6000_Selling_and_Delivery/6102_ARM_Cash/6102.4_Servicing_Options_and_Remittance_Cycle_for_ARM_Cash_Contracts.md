> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview
This section defines Freddie Mac’s requirements for **Servicing options**, **Remittance Cycle**, and **Minimum Contract Servicing Spreads (MCSS)** applicable to Mortgages sold under **ARM Cash Contracts**.  
These provisions govern how Sellers may retain or transfer servicing, and how Servicing Spreads must be selected and applied for ARM transactions.

---

## (a) Servicing Options for ARM Cash

Subject to Freddie Mac’s approval and applicable conditions, Sellers may sell ARMs under ARM Cash using one of the following Servicing structures:

| Servicing Option | Description | Key Conditions |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Servicing Retained** | Seller sells the Mortgage to Freddie Mac and continues to service it in compliance with the Guide and applicable Purchase Documents. | Seller remains the Servicer of record. |
| **2. Concurrent Transfer of Servicing (CTOS)** | Seller sells the Mortgage to Freddie Mac and simultaneously transfers servicing to a Freddie Mac–approved Transferee Servicer. | - Both sale and Transfer of Servicing occur on the **Settlement Date**.<br>- Transferee Servicer must be **Freddie Mac–approved** and eligible for the Mortgage type.<br>- Freddie Mac must **approve** the Transfer per **Chapter 7101**.<br>- See §6302.51 for delivery requirements for servicing-released Mortgages under Mandatory or Best Efforts Cash Contracts. |

## (b) Remittance Cycle and Servicing Spreads for ARM Cash Contracts

### (i) Remittance Cycle
All Mortgages sold under **ARM Cash Contracts** use the **Standard Remittance Cycle**.  
The purchase price received by the Seller reflects this cycle.

---

### (ii) Minimum Contract Servicing Spread (MCSS)
The **Servicing Spread** for any Mortgage delivered under a specific ARM Cash Contract must be:
- **Greater than or equal to**, but **not less than**, the **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread** (MCSS) selected by the Seller for that contract.

#### Key details:
- The MCSS is selected by the Seller **at the time of taking out the Purchase Contract**.  
- It applies to **all Mortgages** delivered under that specific contract.  
- The MCSS must be **equal to or greater than the Minimum Servicing Spread** set by Freddie Mac.  
- In Loan Selling Advisor®, the MCSS is displayed as the **servicing fee rate**.

#### Required MCSS Range for ARM Cash:
| Contract Type | Minimum | Maximum |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| ARM Cash | 0.250% | 0.375% |

Freddie Mac uses the selected MCSS to determine the **acceptable Servicing Spread range** (Loan Level Tolerance) for ARMs allocated to the contract.
