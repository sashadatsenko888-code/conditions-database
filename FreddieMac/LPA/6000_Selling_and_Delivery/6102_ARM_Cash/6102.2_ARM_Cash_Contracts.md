## Overview
This section establishes the operational and pricing requirements for **ARM Cash Contracts**, including offer procedures, seller obligations, pricing methodology, and binding commitment terms under the **ARM Cash Program**.

It applies to all Sellers entering into **Mandatory ARM Cash Contracts** for the sale of adjustable-rate Mortgages (ARMs) to Freddie Mac.

---

## (a) ARM Cash Contracts

### (i) Offer Amounts and Procedures
- Freddie Mac will notify Sellers in advance if commitments will not be available due to holidays or other reasons.  
- **Contracts under ARM Cash are mandatory.**  
- Each Business Day, a Seller may take out one or more contracts to sell ARMs.

#### Key thresholds:
- **Minimum contract amount:** $1,000  
- **Maximum per-day aggregate (Fixed + ARM):** $200 million  
- Exceptions may be requested via the **Cash Desk**  
  📧 Cash_Ex@FreddieMac.com  
  ☎️ (571) 382-5960  

> If a Seller exceeds the daily limit without prior approval, Freddie Mac may pair off the contract(s) or require the Seller to pay all associated costs.

---

### (ii) Seller Obligations
Under each ARM Cash Contract, the Seller must:
1. Deliver Mortgages with an **aggregate UPB equal to the contract amount**, ± the greater of **$10,000 or 2.5%** of that amount, and  
2. Complete all sale requirements by **close of business on the Purchase Contract Expiration Date**.

---

### (iii) Contract Periods
- Purchase Contract periods range from **2 to 90 days**, or as otherwise permitted by Loan Selling Advisor®.  
- Mortgages may settle **individually**, but all must close by the **Expiration Date**.

---

### (iv) Pairoff Process
If the Seller cannot fulfill a contract:
- The Seller may **request a pairoff** via Loan Selling Advisor or allow automatic calculation at contract expiration.  
- The **two-way pairoff** process can result in a fee owed **to or from** Freddie Mac, depending on market conditions.  
- Pairoff fees are **non-negotiable** and appear on the Seller’s **monthly invoice**.  
- See § 6401.1(b) and Chapter 6303 for pairoff handling and payment rules.  

> Freddie Mac may amend pairoff provisions at any time without prior notice.

---

### (v) ARM Cash Contract Extensions
- Sellers may extend contracts **before expiration** through Loan Selling Advisor.  
- **Unlimited extensions** are allowed, provided the total extension period does not exceed **30 days** from the original expiration date.  
- A **fee** applies per § 6303.2(a).

---

## (b) Pricing under ARM Cash

### (i) Loan Level Tolerance
ARMs delivered under an ARM Cash Contract may vary within defined tolerances for these **Loan Attributes**:
- Life Cap  
- Margin  
- Note Rate  
- Months to Next Interest Change Date  
- Servicing Spread  

When establishing a contract, the Seller must enter all data required by Loan Selling Advisor®.  
Freddie Mac uses this data to define the **Loan Level Tolerances** for pricing and eligibility.

---

### (ii) Obtaining Pricing
- Pricing for ARM Cash is available **each Business Day** through Loan Selling Advisor®.  
- Once the Seller **accepts and agrees to a price**, the **contract amount cannot be increased.**  
- To sell additional ARMs, the Seller must create a **new contract**.

---

### (iii) Negotiated Credit Fees
Freddie Mac may assess **negotiated Credit Fees** from time to time.  
These appear on the **loan-level fee breakdown screen** in Loan Selling Advisor®.  

Freddie Mac may:
- amend, supplement, revise, or terminate any such pricing or provisions,  
- in whole or in part,  
- upon **written notice to the Seller**, in accordance with § 1101.2(a)(ii).

---

## (c) Acceptance of Offer under ARM Cash
Once the Seller **accepts and agrees to the contract price** in Loan Selling Advisor®, a **binding commitment** exists:
- Freddie Mac is obligated to purchase, and  
- The Seller is obligated to sell,  
subject to the Mortgage conforming to the **Purchase Documents**.

The complete Purchase Contract terms are provided in Loan Selling Advisor®.  
(See § 1201.4(b) for limited exceptions.)
