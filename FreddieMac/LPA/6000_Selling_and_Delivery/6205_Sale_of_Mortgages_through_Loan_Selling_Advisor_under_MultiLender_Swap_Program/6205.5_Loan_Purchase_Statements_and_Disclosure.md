## Overview
This section outlines Freddie Mac’s **Loan Purchase Statement (Form 15)** requirements and **UMBS®/MBS disclosure standards** for Mortgages sold under the **MultiLender Swap Program** through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.  
It ensures Sellers have access to accurate settlement information and standardized disclosure documents for transparency in securitization.

---

## (a) Loan Purchase Statement
- **Form 15 (Loan Purchase Statement)** — designated **Form 15A** when related to UMBS® or MBS — becomes accessible to the Seller in **Loan Selling Advisor®** **by the first day of the Settlement Cycle** for Mortgages sold under the MultiLender Swap program.  
- The statement provides the detailed purchase summary, loan-level data, and pricing verification necessary for settlement review.  
- Sellers are responsible for verifying the accuracy of all data contained in Form 15 or 15A prior to Pool formation and settlement.

---

## (b) Disclosure for UMBS® and MBS Formed under the MultiLender Swap Program
- For each Pool formed under the MultiLender Swap program, Freddie Mac issues a **Pool Supplement** that includes key information about the Mortgages in the UMBS® or MBS Pool as of the **Settlement Date**.  
- The **Pool Supplement** is released on the **first Business Day following the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Class D Monthly Securities Settlement Date**.

### Access Options
Sellers and investors can obtain the Pool Supplement:
1. On the Freddie Mac Capital Markets website: [https://capitalmarkets.freddiemac.com/mbs](https://capitalmarkets.freddiemac.com/mbs)  
2. Via a **direct link in Loan Selling Advisor®** to **Form 15** (Form 15A for UMBS or MBS)  
3. By contacting **Investor Inquiry** at **(800) 336-3672**

### Related Cross-References
