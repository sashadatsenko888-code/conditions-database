Section: 6205.4 – Remittance Cycle, Credit Fee in Yield, and Servicing Spread for Mortgages Sold through Loan Selling Advisor® under the MultiLender Swap Program  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview
This section defines the **remittance cycle**, **Credit Fee in Yield**, and **Servicing Spread** requirements applicable to **fixed-rate Mortgages** sold through **Loan Selling Advisor®** under Freddie Mac’s **MultiLender Swap Program**.  
It ensures uniform payment timing, consistent pricing through Credit Fee application, and Servicing Spread compliance across all Sellers participating in MultiLender Swaps.

---

## (a) Remittance Cycle Options
- The **Standard Remittance Cycle** applies to all Mortgages sold under the MultiLender Swap program.  
- Sellers must follow the timing, reporting, and remittance requirements outlined in **Chapter 6201**, as amended or supplemented by this chapter or by Loan Selling Advisor system updates.  
- No alternative or accelerated remittance options are permitted for MultiLender Swaps.  

**Reference:** See *Section 6201.8* and *6201.3(c)* for general remittance and Servicing Spread policies applicable to all Guarantor and MultiLender programs.

---

## (b) Credit Fee in Yield (CFIY)
- The **Credit Fee in Yield** applicable to MultiLender Swap transactions is defined by the **Pricing Identifier Terms** associated with each sale.  
- The CFIY represents the pricing adjustment Freddie Mac applies to compensate for credit risk, embedded in the yield differential.  
- Sellers must verify the correct CFIY at contract execution within Loan Selling Advisor to ensure accurate pricing and compliance.

---

## (c) Servicing Spread
- For all MultiLender Swap deliveries:
  - **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread:** 0.250%  
  - **Maximum Servicing Spread:** 0.500%  
- The **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread** must be **equal to or greater than the Minimum Servicing Spread**.  
- This spread includes the compensation for servicing activities and (where applicable) the portion required to cover **lender-paid mortgage insurance (LPMI)** premiums if used.  
- Servicing Spread terms must be correctly recorded in **Loan Selling Advisor®** prior to settlement.

---

## Practical Meaning
- The MultiLender Swap program uses the **same remittance cycle** and **Servicing Spread framework** as the Guarantor program to maintain consistency across Freddie Mac securitizations.  
- Sellers cannot shorten or modify the remittance cycle for faster cash flow.  
- Maintaining the correct **CFIY** and **Servicing Spread range** ensures accurate yield alignment and uniform investor returns.  
- Any deviation outside the required 0.250–0.500 % range would make a loan ineligible for pooling or cause post-settlement adjustments.
