#### (i) Offer Procedures
- The Seller may take out one or more **MultiLender Swap Contracts** each Business Day.  
- When initiating a contract, the Seller must provide the following required information:
  - **Settlement Month** — must be no later than the month in which the latest Settlement Date for the applicable Pricing Identifier occurs.  
  - **Pool** — must have a **Final Settlement Date** on or before the last day of the selected Settlement Month.  
  - **Settlement Date** — must be **on or before** the Pool’s Final Settlement Date.  
  - **Settlement Cycle** — the Seller may choose a **1-, 3-, 4-, or 5-day cycle**.

---

#### (ii) Changing Settlement Date
- Sellers may change the **Settlement Date** **regardless of whether the Settlement Cycle has commenced**.  
- The new Settlement Date must still occur **on or before** the Final Settlement Date of the selected Pool.
- If the Settlement Cycle **has not commenced**, the **Final Delivery Date** may also be changed.  
- Once the Settlement Cycle **has commenced**, the **Final Delivery Date cannot be changed**.

---

#### (iii) Gold Rush Fee®
If the Seller selects a **1-, 3-, or 4-day Settlement Cycle**:
- The Seller must comply with **Section 6302.4(f)** (expedited delivery requirements).  
- A **Gold Rush Fee** applies and must be paid per **Section 6303.2(a)**.  

**Gold Rush Fee characteristics:**
| Attribute | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Expression | Basis points |
| Calculation Base | Aggregate UPB of Mortgages allocated to the funded MultiLender Swap Contract |
| Frequency | Subject to monthly change |
| Availability | Displayed in **Loan Selling Advisor® → Guarantor Rate Sheet → Credit Fees section** |

---

#### (iv) Delivery / Contract Cancelation
- Delivery under a **MultiLender Swap Contract is optional**.  
- The Seller may **cancel** the contract in **Loan Selling Advisor®** until **8:00 p.m. Eastern Time** on the **Business Day immediately preceding the Settlement Date**.

---

### (b) Purchase and Sale Obligations / Commitment Amounts

#### (i) Purchase and Sale Obligations
- The Seller’s **offer to sell Mortgages** occurs when required loan data is entered into **Loan Selling Advisor®** to take out a MultiLender Swap Contract.  
- A **binding contract** is established once the Seller **accepts Freddie Mac’s terms and conditions** in Loan Selling Advisor.  

---

#### (ii) Commitment Amounts
- Sellers must monitor the **aggregate unpaid principal balance (UPB)** of all Mortgages delivered to Freddie Mac under the **Pricing Identifier Terms**.  
- The Seller must ensure that the **Commitment Amount tolerance is not exceeded**.  
- Exceeding tolerance may result in **penalties or settlement exceptions** under Freddie Mac’s purchase documentation.

---

## Practical Meaning
- Sellers may create and modify MultiLender Swap Contracts daily, provided they stay within the designated Settlement Month and Pool limits.  
- The program allows flexible delivery or cancellation prior to settlement, giving Sellers control over execution timing.  
- The Gold Rush Fee incentivizes faster settlements (1–4 days) and must be factored into pricing.  
- All contract acceptances through Loan Selling Advisor are binding and enforceable once confirmed.
