Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section governs the **purchase, pooling, loan data submission, and wire transfer requirements** for Mortgages sold through **Loan Selling Advisor®** under Freddie Mac’s **MultiLender Swap Program**.  
It defines acceptable Note Rate margins, required loan data import procedures, and strict wire instruction and authorization protocols to ensure secure and accurate settlements.

---

## (a) Purchase and Pooling Requirements
- Freddie Mac purchases **conventional fixed-rate Mortgages** with Note Rates (after adjustments for buyups/buydowns and any lender-paid MI premiums) **within the posted Note Rate range** for the program.
- Eligible Note Rate margins:
  - Minimum: **0.250% above the Security Coupon**
  - Maximum: **1.125% above the Security Coupon**
- Minimum commitment amount: **$1,000**
- All Mortgages must comply with:
  - **Chapter 6201** — general MultiLender Swap requirements
  - **Chapter 6202** — Freddie Mac swap disclosure and pooling standards for fixed-rate Mortgages

**Reference:** Chapter 6202 governs detailed pooling and disclosure structure for all MultiLender fixed-rate transactions.

---

## (b) Providing Data for Mortgages Sold under the MultiLender Swap Program
The Seller must provide complete loan data through one of the following methods:
1. **Importing required data** directly into **Loan Selling Advisor®**, or  
2. **Importing Loan Prospector® data** using the Key Number, or  
3. **Manual entry** of loan data for each Mortgage in Loan Selling Advisor.

After data entry, the Seller must **allocate the loans** to the appropriate **MultiLender Swap Contract**.

> **Loan Selling Advisor automatically assigns Freddie Mac loan numbers** for all Mortgages sold under this program.

---

## (c) Wire Transfer Instructions and Delivery of UMBS® / MBS

### (i) Wire Instructions Management
- Sellers must **assign and manage wire transfer instructions** within **Loan Selling Advisor®** for all MultiLender Swap sales.

#### (A) Employee Designation Requirements
- Under **Section 2403.11**, Sellers must provide Freddie Mac with information identifying authorized **Loan Selling Advisor users** and their assigned **Setup Manager roles**.
- Authorized personnel responsible for providing or modifying wire instructions must be listed on one of the following:
  - **Form 988SF** – Certificate of Incumbency (for corporations, credit unions, LLCs, banks)
  - **Form 989SF** – Certificate of Incumbency (for limited partnerships)
- See **Section 2201.1** for full Certificate of Incumbency requirements.

#### (B) Timing for Wire Instructions
| Requirement | Deadline |
|--------------|-----------|
| Complete wire instructions in Loan Selling Advisor | **No later than 8:00 p.m. ET on the Final Delivery Date** |
| Submit revised wire transfer instructions (if changed) | **No later than 8:00 p.m. ET on the last Business Day before the Settlement Date** |

Failure to meet these timing standards may delay settlement or prevent contract entry into the Settlement Cycle.

---

### (ii) Delivery of Pledged Mortgages
- For **Pledged Mortgages**, the Warehouse Lender must submit **Form 996E (Warehouse Provider Release and Transfer)** through Loan Selling Advisor by **8:00 p.m. ET on the Final Delivery Date**.
- If wire instructions change, Form 996E may be **revised and resubmitted by 12:30 p.m. ET on the last Business Day before Settlement**.

---

### (iii) Accuracy of Information
- The Seller is **fully responsible for the accuracy** of all data and instructions provided, including wire transfer details.  
- Freddie Mac is **not liable** for delivery errors if UMBS® or MBS were transferred based on Seller-provided data that was not updated in accordance with Purchase Document requirements.  
- See **Section 6201.11** for additional liability provisions.

---

## Practical Meaning
- Sellers must maintain strict control over who can authorize and modify wire instructions within Loan Selling Advisor.  
- Timing windows (8:00 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. ET deadlines) are non-negotiable and directly affect settlement eligibility.  
- Mortgage eligibility and pricing depend on precise Note Rate margins and compliance with pooling standards in Chapter 6202.  
- Warehouse lenders must coordinate timely Form 996E submissions to release pledged collateral.
