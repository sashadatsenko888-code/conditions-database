Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s rules for **Best Efforts Contracts** under the Fixed-Rate Cash program.  
It defines eligibility, contract procedures, pricing rules, extension policies, and payup eligibility managed through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

## (a) Offer Amounts and Procedures

Each Business Day, a Seller may take out a **Best Efforts Contract** to sell a **specific fixed-rate Mortgage** to Freddie Mac.  
Freddie Mac will notify Sellers in advance if commitments are unavailable due to holidays or other events.

### Contract Amounts
- **Minimum contract amount:** $1,000  
- Freddie Mac may, at its discretion, impose a **maximum contract amount**.

### Seller Obligations
Under a Best Efforts Contract, the Seller must:
1. **Use best efforts** to close and fund the specified Mortgage.  
2. **Sell the Mortgage** to Freddie Mac at a cash price determined by Freddie Mac **if the same Borrower(s) and property address loan closes and funds**.  
3. Abide by the **Purchase Contract terms** available in Loan Selling Advisor®.  

If the Mortgage closes and funds **after the contract expires**, the Seller is still **obligated to sell** it to Freddie Mac under that same contract (see §6101.4(c) for pricing).  

If, despite best efforts, the Mortgage **does not close and fund**, no pairoff fee applies. The Seller may **substitute another loan** to fulfill the contract; pricing adjustments may apply.

However, the Seller **indemnifies Freddie Mac** for any costs or losses resulting from failure to sell a Mortgage that was closed and funded.

### Prohibited Actions
The Seller **may not**:
- Take out a **duplicate Best Efforts or Mandatory Contract** (sequentially or simultaneously) for the same loan.  
- Enter a contract using **fictitious Borrower data or property address**.  
- Sell a loan covered by a Best Efforts Contract to another investor.

Violations may result in **immediate termination** of the Seller’s eligibility to participate in Best Efforts Contracts.

---

## (b) Contract Periods

In **Loan Selling Advisor**, the **Purchase Contract Effective Period** defines how long a price remains valid for a Best Efforts Contract.

- Seller may select a period of **2 to 90 days**, or other permitted duration.  
- All requirements for the specified loan must be fulfilled by the **Purchase Contract Expiration Date**.

---

## (c) Pricing for Best Efforts Contracts

Freddie Mac provides **daily pricing** in Loan Selling Advisor based on expected UMBS®/MBS market prices.  
Pricing also reflects:
- the **Mortgage Note Rate**,  
- the **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread**,  
- the **delivery period**, and  
- the **cost of managing interest rate risk** for the Seller.

Posted prices assume:
- **0.250% Minimum Servicing Spread**, and  
- the **Standard Remittance Cycle**.

### Key Pricing Provisions
- Prices update throughout the day with market movement.  
- Freddie Mac may factor in the Seller’s **success rate in closing loans** under Best Efforts Contracts when determining pricing.  
  - Failure to close or fund loans as contracted may negatively affect future pricing.  
- If any Mortgage characteristics change (e.g., term from 30-year to 15-year), the Seller must **modify data** without creating a new contract. The loan is re-priced using the **original acceptance date** price.  
- If a closed/funded Mortgage is sold **after contract expiration**, Freddie Mac re-prices the loan **at the time of sale**.  

### Seller Indemnification
Seller indemnifies Freddie Mac for all losses arising from incomplete or inaccurate data on loans sold under Best Efforts Contracts that would have resulted in different pricing if complete and accurate.

---

## (d) Best Efforts Contract Extensions

If the specified loan will not close before the expiration date, the Seller may extend the contract **in Loan Selling Advisor prior to expiration**.

### Extension Rules
- May extend **unlimited times**, provided:
  - Total term (original + extensions) ≤ **120 days**.  
  - Each extension < **90 days** beyond the current date.  
- An **extension fee** applies, as outlined in §6303.2(a).

---

## (e) Specified Payups for Best Efforts Cash Contracts

Certain loans may qualify for **specified payups** (pricing premiums) under Best Efforts Contracts.

### Requirements
- Contract must be **10-, 15-, 20-, or 30-year fixed-rate Best Efforts**.  
- Payups apply for the **full commitment period**, including extensions.  
- **All Mortgages** within the contract must meet payup requirements.  
- Loans not meeting payup criteria cannot be allocated to that contract.

Eligible Mortgage characteristics are available in **Loan Selling Advisor**.
