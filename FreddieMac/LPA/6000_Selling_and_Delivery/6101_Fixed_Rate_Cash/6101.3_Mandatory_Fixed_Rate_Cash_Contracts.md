---

## Overview
This section outlines Freddie Mac’s requirements and operational rules for **Mandatory Fixed-Rate Cash Contracts** under the Cash Program.  
It details contract eligibility, offer procedures, pricing, payups, pairoffs, and extension processes managed through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

## (a) Offer Amounts and Procedures

Each Business Day, Sellers may execute **Mandatory Cash Contracts** to sell one or more Mortgages to Freddie Mac.  
Freddie Mac will notify Sellers in advance if commitments are unavailable due to holidays or other operational reasons.

### Key Rules
- **Minimum contract amount:** $1,000.  
- **Maximum aggregate daily volume:** $200 million (includes fixed-rate and WAC ARM commitments per §6102.2(a)).  
- Sellers may request exceptions via the **Cash Desk** (Cash_Ex@FreddieMac.com or 571-382-5960).  
- Exceeding the daily cap without approval allows Freddie Mac to **pair off contracts** or require Seller to **pair off at its expense**.

### Seller obligations
Under a Mandatory Contract, the Seller must:
1. Deliver Mortgages meeting all Purchase Contract requirements with total UPB equal to the contract amount (within purchase tolerance per §6401.1).  
2. Complete all sale and delivery requirements by the **Purchase Contract Expiration Date**.

Terms are confirmed within **Loan Selling Advisor® Purchase Contract Confirmation**.

---

## (b) Contract Periods

In **Loan Selling Advisor**, the **Purchase Contract Effective Period** is the timeframe for which Freddie Mac’s price offer remains valid.  
- The Seller may select a contract period between **2 and 90 days**, or another permitted timeframe.  
- All sale requirements must be fulfilled by the **Purchase Contract Expiration Date**.

---

## (c) Pricing

Freddie Mac posts **daily pricing** in Loan Selling Advisor based on expected UMBS®/MBS market performance.  
Prices reflect:
- the **Mortgage Note Rate**,  
- the **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread**, and  
- the **delivery period**.  

Freddie Mac updates prices intraday to reflect securities market movements.  
Posted prices assume:
- **0.250% Minimum Servicing Spread**, and  
- the **Standard Remittance Cycle**.

### Pricing Adjustments
- Prices may adjust as the Seller allocates loans or updates data.  
- Sellers **indemnify Freddie Mac** for costs if Freddie purchases a Mortgage based on incomplete or inaccurate data that would have resulted in a different price.

Once a Seller **accepts and agrees** to the contract price:
- Freddie Mac is **bound to purchase**, and  
- the Seller is **bound to sell**  
Mortgages that meet all Purchase Document requirements.

## (d) Specified Payups

Certain Mortgages may receive **specified payups** (pricing premiums) when sold under eligible Mandatory Cash Contracts.

### Key Requirements
- Contract term: 10-, 15-, 20-, or 30-year mandatory fixed-rate contract.  
- Payups apply for **full commitment periods**, including extensions.  
- **All Mortgages within a contract** must meet payup eligibility requirements.  
- Non-conforming Mortgages cannot be allocated to the contract.  

Mortgage characteristics eligible for payups are displayed in Loan Selling Advisor.  
Super conforming Mortgages may be subject to additional price adjustments.  
Refer to:
- **§4603 (Super Conforming Eligibility)**  
- **§6302.31 (Delivery Requirements for Fixed-Rate Cash Contracts for Super Conforming Mortgages)**

## (e) Mandatory Cash Contract Pairoffs

If the Seller cannot fulfill the contract amount:
- A **pairoff** may be requested via Loan Selling Advisor, or  
- Loan Selling Advisor will automatically calculate the pairoff fee upon expiration.

### Pairoff Features
- **Two-way process** — may result in a fee due **to** or **from** Freddie Mac, depending on market changes.  
- Sellers may re-allocate loans from an expiring contract by:  
  1. Pairing off part/all of an existing contract.  
  2. Executing a new contract with different terms.  
  3. Transferring unfunded loans to the new contract.  
- Pairoff fees calculated in Loan Selling Advisor are **non-negotiable**.  
- Freddie Mac reserves the right to amend pairoff provisions (including §6401.1) without notice.

---

## (f) Contract Extensions

If the Seller cannot deliver all Mortgages by the expiration date, the Seller may extend the **Mandatory Cash Contract** in Loan Selling Advisor.

### Extension Rules
- May extend **any time on or before expiration**.  
- Unlimited number of extensions permitted, provided:  
  - Total term (original + extensions) ≤ **120 days**, and  
  - Each extension ≤ **90 days** beyond current date.  
- **Extension fees** are assessed per §6303.2(a).
