## (a) Servicing Options

Subject to Freddie Mac’s approval and applicable conditions, Sellers may sell fixed-rate Mortgages under the Cash program using **one of three Servicing structures**:

| Servicing Option | Description | Key Conditions |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Servicing Retained** | Seller sells the Mortgage to Freddie Mac and continues servicing in compliance with the Guide and Purchase Documents. | Seller remains the Servicer of record. |
| **2. Concurrent Transfer of Servicing (CTOS)** | Seller sells the Mortgage and concurrently initiates a **Transfer of Servicing** to a Freddie Mac–approved Transferee Servicer. | - Both the sale and transfer occur on the Settlement Date.<br>- Transferee Servicer must be **Freddie Mac–approved**.<br>- Freddie Mac must **approve the transfer** per Chapter 7101.<br>- See §6302.51 for delivery requirements for servicing-released Mortgages. |
| **3. Cash-Released XChange®** | Seller sells the Mortgage **servicing-released** under the Cash-Released XChange® program. | Must comply with all requirements of **§6101.7**. |

## (b) Remittance Cycle

- All Mortgages sold under **Mandatory** or **Best Efforts** Fixed-Rate Cash Contracts use the **Standard Remittance Cycle**.  
- The **purchase price** received by the Seller reflects this standard cycle.

---

## (c) Minimum Contract Servicing Spread (MCSS)

The **Servicing Spread** applicable to each Mortgage under a Purchase Contract may be:
- **equal to or greater than** the Minimum Contract Servicing Spread (MCSS), but  
- **not less than** the MCSS selected by the Seller for that specific contract.

### Seller Selection
- The **MCSS** is chosen by the Seller at the time of taking out a Purchase Contract.  
- It applies to **all Mortgages delivered** under that specific contract.  
- The MCSS must be **equal to or greater than the Minimum Servicing Spread** established by Freddie Mac.

### Fixed-Rate Cash Requirements
| Contract Type | Minimum | Maximum |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Fixed-Rate Cash | 0.250% | 0.500% |
| Cash-Released XChange® | **Exactly 0.250%** | — |

### Lender-Paid Mortgage Insurance (LPMI)
For Mortgages with **annual or monthly premium LPMI**, the Seller must select an MCSS sufficient to ensure:
- the Servicer receives at least the **Minimum Servicing Spread**, **plus**
- an additional amount to cover the **LPMI premium** due.  

Refer to **§4701.2(b)** for LPMI eligibility and calculation details.
