## (a) Eligible Mortgages under Fixed-Rate Cash

Freddie Mac will **purchase fixed-rate Mortgages** sold under the Fixed-Rate Cash program.

For detailed product eligibility, Sellers must refer to:  
- **Exhibit 17S – Available Mortgage Products**, and  
- Freddie Mac’s **Available Products Fact Sheet**:  
  [https://sf.freddiemac.com/docs/pdf/fact-sheet/available_products.pdf](https://sf.freddiemac.com/docs/pdf/fact-sheet/available_products.pdf)

Mortgages eligible for sale through **Cash-Released XChange®** under either:
- a **Mandatory Cash Contract**, or  
- a **Best Efforts Contract**,  

are also listed in the Freddie Mac fact sheet linked above.

## (b) Eligible Original Maturities

Although general maturity limits are established in **Section 4201.3**, the following **specific maturity requirements** apply to **Fixed-Rate Cash** Mortgages:

| Contract Type | Original Maturity (from Origination Date) |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 10-Year Contract | > 84 months and ≤ 10 years |
| 15-Year Contract | > 10 years and ≤ 15 years |
| 20-Year Contract | > 15 years and ≤ 20 years |
| 30-Year Contract | > 20 years and ≤ 30 years |

These limits ensure that the delivered Mortgage aligns with the term specified in the Purchase Contract.
