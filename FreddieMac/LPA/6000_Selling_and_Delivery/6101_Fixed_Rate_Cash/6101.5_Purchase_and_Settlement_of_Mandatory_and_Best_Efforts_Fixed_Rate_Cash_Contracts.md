## Overview
This section outlines Freddie Mac’s procedures for **funding, settlement, and interest calculations** related to **Mandatory** and **Best Efforts Fixed-Rate Cash Contracts**.  
It establishes timelines for funding, calculation of purchase amounts, and Servicer interest treatment associated with Mortgage delivery.

---

## (a) Funding Date

By the **close of business on the Purchase Contract Expiration Date**, the Seller must have completed **all requirements for sale** of Mortgages to Freddie Mac.

### Seller Options
Sellers may:
1. **Request a specific Funding Date** for each Mortgage sold under a Mandatory or Best Efforts Contract, **or**  
2. Elect **“ASAP funding”** — meaning funding occurs **as soon as practicable** after all sale requirements have been met.

Freddie Mac will fund accordingly upon confirmation of eligibility and documentation.

---

## (b) Funding Amount

For each funded Mortgage, Freddie Mac pays the Seller an amount calculated as:

> **Funding Amount = Contract Price × Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB)**

### Adjustments for Credit Fees
If a Mortgage is subject to **Credit Fees** or **Credit Fee credits**, Freddie Mac will:
- **net** such fee or credit against the payment made to the Seller, and  
- reflect any subsequent changes to these fees or credits on the **Seller’s monthly invoice**.

---

## (c) Interest Paid to the Servicer in Connection with Mortgage Funding

When a Mortgage funds, Freddie Mac determines the amount of **interest payable to the Servicer** by computing interest on the UPB from:

> the **first day of the Funding Date month** through **the day before the Funding Date**,  
> using the **Accounting Net Yield (ANY)** rate.

Thereafter:
- Freddie Mac compensates the Servicer by authorizing it to **retain the Servicing Spread** from Borrower interest payments.  
- The Servicer must **remit the Accounting Net Yield (ANY)** portion to Freddie Mac.
