Section: 6101.7 – Requirements for Fixed-Rate Cash Contracts through Cash-Released XChange®  
Effective Date: 09/10/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section establishes the requirements for selling **fixed-rate Mortgages** under **Mandatory** or **Best Efforts** Cash Contracts through **Cash-Released XChange®**.  
It defines approval procedures, pricing rules, Transferee Servicer selection, funding adjustments, and ongoing Seller obligations.

Freddie Mac arranges for a **Transferee Servicer** to accept a **Concurrent Transfer of Servicing** from the Seller at the time of sale.  
All requirements are governed by:
- this section,  
- **Exhibit 28A – Loan Servicing Purchase and Sale Agreement for Cash-Released XChange®**, and  
- other applicable Purchase Documents.

---

## General Participation Requirements

- The Seller must apply to Freddie Mac for **approval and access** to Cash-Released XChange.  
- Freddie Mac determines eligibility and grants system access upon approval.  
- Contact: **Freddie Mac representative** or **800-FREDDIE**.

Freddie Mac may, with notice:
1. Limit the total **UPB** of Mortgages sold through Cash-Released XChange.  
2. Impose **additional participation requirements**.  
3. **Suspend or terminate** Seller participation at its discretion.

---

## (a) Cash-Released XChange Pricing

The price under a **Mandatory** or **Best Efforts** Contract through Cash-Released XChange includes:

1. **Freddie Mac’s price** for purchase of the Mortgage(s).  
2. **Transferee Servicer’s price** for the related Servicing Contract Rights.

### Key Points
- Final pricing is determined **as of the Funding Date**, based on Mortgage data provided by the Seller.  
- Late fees (per §6101.7(h) and Exhibit 28A) are excluded from the purchase price.  
- Late fees may apply for:
  - late document delivery to the Transferee Servicer, or  
  - failure to reconcile funds or identify adjustments timely.

---

## (b) Availability of Servicing-Released Prices

Only **fixed-rate Mortgages** for which **Loan Selling Advisor®** provides a **servicing-released price** may be sold via Cash-Released XChange.  

If no Transferee Servicer submits a bid for a Mortgage:
- Cash-Released XChange is **not available** for that loan.  
- Such loans may still be sold to Freddie Mac **servicing-retained**.

### Seller Data Obligations
The Seller must provide complete Mortgage data fields titled:
- “Loan Fields Required for Pricing”, and  
- “Additional Loan Fields That Affect Pricing”.

Failure to provide full data may cause **rescission of a Servicing bid**.  
If no alternative bid exists under a **Mandatory Cash Contract**, the Seller incurs a **pairoff fee** per §6401.1.

---

## (c) Funding Adjustments and Net Funding

Funding adjustments include:  
**Escrow funds, interest adjustment, Servicing Spread, tax service fee, transaction fee, and temporary subsidy buydown funds.**

### Process
1. Seller enters Escrow and temporary buydown amounts in **Loan Selling Advisor**.  
2. Loan Selling Advisor calculates the other adjustment components.  
3. Freddie Mac deducts total adjustments from the purchase proceeds and forwards them to the Transferee Servicer.

### Seller Responsibilities
- Seller is solely responsible for the **accuracy of Escrow and buydown amounts** entered.  
- Freddie Mac does **not validate or correct** these amounts.  
- Any post-funding corrections must be handled directly between the **Seller and Transferee Servicer**.

---

## (d) Identification of Transferee Servicers

Freddie Mac designates **Freddie Mac-approved Servicers** as Transferee Servicers participating in Cash-Released XChange.

---

## (e) Excluding Transferee Servicers

- Loan Selling Advisor notifies the Seller of available Transferee Servicers.  
- Seller may **exclude** any Transferee Servicer from assuming its Servicing Contract Rights.  
- Exclusion does **not apply retroactively** to contracts already executed.  
- Upon **re-pricing**, a new Servicer bid may be accepted.  
- The Seller must verify the Servicer’s identity in the **Contract Confirmation**.  
- Seller may later **restore** a previously excluded Servicer.

---

## (f) Authorization to Disclose Seller Identity

The Seller authorizes Freddie Mac to disclose to any Transferee Servicer:
- that the Seller is an **eligible Transferor Servicer**,  
- or, if applicable, that the Seller is **no longer approved** or **no longer eligible** for Cash-Released XChange.

Freddie Mac may also share additional information necessary for Servicing continuity.

---

## (g) Servicer’s Right to Screen Out Seller

A Transferee Servicer may **terminate the Seller’s ability to transfer Servicing Contract Rights** at any time, without notice.  
The Seller waives all rights of appeal or recourse against Freddie Mac or the Servicer for such action.

---

## (h) Late Fees

Freddie Mac may assess **up to $500 per Mortgage** when the Seller fails to:
- comply with Exhibit 28A § 4.2,  
- properly identify or reconcile funding adjustments as required by §6101.7(c) or Exhibit 28A § 5.1.  

These are **in addition to any Servicer late fees** specified in Exhibit 28A.

---

## (i) Warranties

For Mortgages sold through Cash-Released XChange:
- The **Seller** remains fully liable to Freddie Mac for all **sale representations and warranties** in the Purchase Documents.  
- The **Transferee Servicer** assumes all **Servicing obligations, warranties, and liabilities** related to the concurrent transfer.

Freddie Mac performs **quality-control reviews** on sale warranties with the Seller and may share findings and defect reports with the Transferee Servicer.

---

## (j) Document Custody

For non-eMortgages sold through Cash-Released XChange:
- **Notes must be delivered** to a Document Custodian listed in **Exhibit 43**.  
- See § 2202.3(c) for document custody rules.  

For eMortgages:
- Refer to **Chapter 1402**, **Directory 4**, and the Seller’s **Purchase Documents** for delivery and control requirements.
