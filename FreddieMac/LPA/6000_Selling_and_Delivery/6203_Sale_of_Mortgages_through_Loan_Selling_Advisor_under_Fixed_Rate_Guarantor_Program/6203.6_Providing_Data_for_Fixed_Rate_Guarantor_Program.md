Section: 6203.6 – Providing Data for Mortgages Sold through Loan Selling Advisor® under the Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program  
Effective Date: 12/11/2017  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section describes the methods Sellers must use to **enter and transmit loan data** for Mortgages sold under the **Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program** through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Acceptable Data Submission Methods
The Seller must provide complete and accurate data for all Mortgages sold under the Guarantor program using one of the following methods:

1. **Importing required data** directly into **Loan Selling Advisor®**, or  
2. **Importing data** from **Loan Product Advisor® (LPA)** using the loan’s **Key Number**, or  
3. **Manually entering** each Mortgage’s loan data directly into **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

### (b) Loan Allocation
- After loan data is entered or imported, the Seller must **allocate the loans** to a **Fixed-Rate Guarantor Contract**.  
- Only properly allocated loans are eligible for purchase and inclusion in UMBS®/MBS Pools.

---

### (c) Freddie Mac Loan Numbers
- **Loan Selling Advisor® automatically assigns Freddie Mac loan numbers** to all Mortgages sold under the Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program.  
- These loan numbers become the permanent identifiers for Freddie Mac’s internal tracking and post-settlement reporting.

---

## Practical Meaning
Sellers can submit loans in three ways — import, sync from LPA, or manual entry — but **allocation to a Guarantor Contract is mandatory** for purchase eligibility.  
Freddie Mac loan numbers are created automatically after successful allocation.
