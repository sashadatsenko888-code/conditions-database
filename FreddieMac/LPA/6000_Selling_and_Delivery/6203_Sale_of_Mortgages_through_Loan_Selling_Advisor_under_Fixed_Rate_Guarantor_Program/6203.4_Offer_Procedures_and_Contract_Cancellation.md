## Overview
Sellers may take out one or more **Fixed-Rate Guarantor Contracts** each Business Day through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.  
This section defines the required inputs, permitted Settlement Cycles, change procedures, applicable fees, and contract cancellation rules.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Required Information
When creating a Fixed-Rate Guarantor Contract, the Seller must provide:
- **Settlement Date** (must be a Business Day on or before the Pricing Identifier Expiration Date)
- **Settlement Cycle** — 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-day (standard)  
  or **6–15-day** (for early pool disclosure)

---

### (b) Settlement Date Modifications
| Condition | Change Allowed | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| **Before Settlement Cycle begins** | May change to a Business Day in same or different month, provided new date ≤ Pricing Identifier Expiration Date. | Final Delivery Date may also change. |
| **After Settlement Cycle begins** | May change only to a later Business Day in the same month (≤ Expiration Date). | Final Delivery Date **cannot** change. |

---

### (c) Early Pool Disclosure and Removals
- For **6–15-day Settlement Cycles**, Mortgages may be removed **48 hours prior to Settlement Date** if they are paid before funding.  
- Sellers must continue to meet Chapter **6202** pooling and disclosure requirements.  
- Removal requests are submitted to **Customer Service (800-FREDDIE)**.

---

### (d) Gold Rush® Fee
- Applies when Seller selects a **2-, 3-, or 4-day Settlement Cycle**.  
- Calculated as:
  - Expressed in **basis points**.  
  - Applied to aggregate **UPB** of Mortgages in the Contract funded by Freddie Mac.  
  - **Rates update monthly** and appear on the **Guarantor Rate Sheet** (Credit Fees section).  
- Paid according to **Section 6303.2**.

---

### (e) Minimum Pool Amount
- See **Section 6202.3** — minimum aggregate UPB of $1,000,000 for UMBS® and MBS Pools.

---

### (f) Optional Delivery and Contract Cancellation
- Delivery under a Fixed-Rate Guarantor Contract is **optional**.  
- The Seller may **cancel** a Fixed-Rate Guarantor Contract in **Loan Selling Advisor®** up to  
  **8:00 p.m. Eastern Time** on the **Business Day immediately preceding** the Settlement Date.

---

## Practical Meaning
When managing Guarantor Contracts:
- Always confirm Settlement Date ≤ Pricing Identifier Expiration Date.  
- Understand early pool disclosure timelines (6–15-day) and removal process.  
- Expect Gold Rush® fee for accelerated 2–4-day cycles.  
- Contracts remain cancellable until the evening before Settlement.
