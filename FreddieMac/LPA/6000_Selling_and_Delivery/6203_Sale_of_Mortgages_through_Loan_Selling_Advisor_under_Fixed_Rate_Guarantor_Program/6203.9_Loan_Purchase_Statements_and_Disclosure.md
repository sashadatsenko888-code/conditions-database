## Overview
This section outlines Seller obligations and Freddie Mac disclosure practices related to **Loan Purchase Statements (Form 15/15A)** and **Pool-level disclosures** for UMBS® and MBS under the **Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program**.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Loan Purchase Statement
- **Form 15 (Loan Purchase Statement)** — or **Form 15A** (for UMBS® or MBS) — will be available to the Seller in **Loan Selling Advisor®** by the **first day of the Settlement Cycle**.
- Sellers who selected a **6–15 day Settlement Cycle** and later **removed Mortgages** from an early pool disclosure contract (as permitted in **Section 6203.4**) must access an **updated Form 15** reflecting the revised pool composition.

---

### (b) Disclosure for UMBS® and MBS Formed under the Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program
- For each Pool formed under the program, **Freddie Mac provides a Pool Supplement** available:
  - On Freddie Mac’s website: [www.freddiemac.com/mbs/](https://www.freddiemac.com/mbs/)
  - Via a **direct link in Loan Selling Advisor®** to Form 15 or Form 15A.
- The **Pool Supplement** is published on the **first day of the Settlement Cycle** and includes:
  - Detailed information about the Mortgages in the Pool as of the **Settlement Date**.  
- Sellers may also request a copy by contacting **Investor Inquiry** at **(800) 336-3672**.

> Refer to **Section 6201.16(a)** for full disclosure and correction procedures, including Freddie Mac’s reliance on Seller-provided data.

---

## Practical Meaning
- Form 15/15A acts as Freddie Mac’s **official confirmation** of purchased loans and must be reviewed for accuracy before Settlement.  
- The **Pool Supplement** is a public disclosure document for investors and must match the Seller’s submitted data; any discrepancies must be reported immediately.  
- Early pool changes require downloading the **updated Form 15** to ensure compliance and data integrity.
