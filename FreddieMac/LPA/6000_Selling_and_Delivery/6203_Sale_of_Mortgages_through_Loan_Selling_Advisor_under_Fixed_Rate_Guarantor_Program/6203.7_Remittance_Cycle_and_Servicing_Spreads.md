Section: 6203.7 – Remittance Cycle and Servicing Spreads for Mortgages Sold through Loan Selling Advisor® under the Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program  
Effective Date: 06/03/2019  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section specifies the **remittance cycle** and **Servicing Spread requirements** for fixed-rate Mortgages sold under the **Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program** through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Remittance Cycle
- The **Standard Remittance Cycle** applies to all Mortgages sold under a **Fixed-Rate Guarantor Contract**.  
- No alternative or modified remittance schedules are permitted unless explicitly authorized by Freddie Mac.

---

### (b) Servicing Spread
- Within **Loan Selling Advisor®**, the term *Minimum Required Servicing Spread* corresponds to **Minimum Contract Servicing Spread**, as defined in the Freddie Mac Guide.  
- The following limits apply to Mortgages sold under the Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program:

| Type of Mortgage | Minimum Servicing Spread | Maximum Servicing Spread |
|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Standard fixed-rate | 0.25% | 0.50% |
| Fixed-rate with annual or monthly **lender-paid mortgage insurance (LPMI)** | 0.25% (must include MI renewal premium) | 0.50% |

- The Minimum Contract Servicing Spread must include the amount necessary to **cover LPMI premiums when due**.

---

## Practical Meaning
Every loan under the Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program must:
1. Follow the **Standard Remittance Cycle** for payments to Freddie Mac.  
2. Maintain a **Servicing Spread** between **0.25% and 0.50%**, ensuring coverage of any LPMI premiums.  

Exceeding or undercutting these bounds violates Freddie Mac servicing and pricing requirements.
