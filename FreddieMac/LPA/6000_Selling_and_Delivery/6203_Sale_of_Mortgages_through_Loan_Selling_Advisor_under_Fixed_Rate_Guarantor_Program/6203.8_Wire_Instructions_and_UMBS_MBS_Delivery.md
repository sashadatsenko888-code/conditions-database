Effective Date: 02/02/2022  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section establishes the procedures and timing for providing **wire transfer instructions** and managing **UMBS®/MBS delivery** for Mortgages sold under the **Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program** through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Wire Instruction Management
- Sellers must **assign and manage wire instructions** directly within **Loan Selling Advisor®** for all Mortgages sold under the Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program.  
- These instructions define where Freddie Mac transfers funds or securities upon settlement.

---

### (b) Authorized Personnel
- Per **Section 2403.11**, Sellers must identify authorized **Loan Selling Advisor® users**.  
- Employees designated as **Setup Managers** must also be listed as authorized signers on Freddie Mac’s **Certificate of Incumbency forms**:  
  - **Form 988SF** — for corporations, LLCs, banks, or credit unions.  
  - **Form 989SF** — for limited partnerships.  
- See **Section 2201.1** for additional Certificate of Incumbency requirements.

### (c) Deadlines for Wire Instructions
| Action | Deadline (Eastern Time) | Notes |
|--------|--------------------------|-------|
| Complete wiring instructions for contract | **By 8:00 p.m. ET** on the **Final Delivery Date** | Required for contract to enter Settlement Cycle |
| Revise wire instructions | **By 8:00 p.m. ET** on the **Business Day before Settlement Date** | Changes must be made in Loan Selling Advisor |
| Submit **Form 996E (Warehouse Provider Release and Transfer)** | **By 8:00 p.m. ET** on the **Final Delivery Date** | Applies if Pledged Mortgages are included |
| Resubmit Form 996E (if wire changes)** | **By 12:30 p.m. ET** on the **Business Day before Settlement Date** | Must reflect updated instructions |

---

### (d) Pledged Mortgages
- If **Pledged Mortgages** are allocated to a contract:
  - The **Warehouse Lender** must submit **Form 996E** through **Loan Selling Advisor®** by the stated deadline.  
  - Any revisions must be submitted again by 12:30 p.m. ET on the Business Day before Settlement.

---

### (e) Liability and Accuracy
- The **Seller bears full responsibility** for the accuracy of all wire and delivery instructions submitted through Loan Selling Advisor®.  
- Freddie Mac is **not liable** for errors in UMBS® or MBS delivery if:
  - The delivery followed Seller-provided instructions; and  
  - Those instructions were not properly updated under the requirements of the Purchase Documents.

---

## Practical Meaning
- The Seller’s internal admin team must set up authorized users and wire destinations ahead of the **Final Delivery Date**.  
- Any last-minute changes must be completed by **8:00 p.m. ET (or 12:30 p.m. for warehouse corrections)**.  
- If Freddie Mac sends funds or MBS to the wrong place due to Seller error, the Seller—not Freddie Mac—bears the loss.
