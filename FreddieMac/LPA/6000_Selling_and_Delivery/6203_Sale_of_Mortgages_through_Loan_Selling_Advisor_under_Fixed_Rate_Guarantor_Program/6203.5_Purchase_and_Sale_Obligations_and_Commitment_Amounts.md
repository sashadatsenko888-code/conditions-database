Section: 6203.5 – Purchase and Sale Obligations and Commitment Amounts for Fixed-Rate Guarantor Contracts  
Effective Date: 12/11/2017  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines when a **binding sale contract** is formed between the Seller and Freddie Mac under the **Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program**, and establishes requirements for monitoring **Commitment Amount tolerances**.

---

## Key Requirements

### (a) Purchase and Sale Obligations
- A **Seller’s offer** occurs when required data is entered into **Loan Selling Advisor®** to take out a Fixed-Rate Guarantor Contract.  
- A **binding contract** is established **only when the Seller accepts** the contract terms and conditions presented by Freddie Mac.  
- Upon acceptance:
  - The Seller is legally obligated to deliver Mortgages meeting the program requirements.  
  - Freddie Mac is obligated to purchase those Mortgages, subject to conformity with the **Purchase Documents**.

---

### (b) Commitment Amounts
- The Seller must **track the total unpaid principal balance (UPB)** of all Mortgages delivered to Freddie Mac under each applicable **Pricing Identifier**.  
- The aggregate UPB must **not exceed the Commitment Amount tolerance** defined in the **Pricing Identifier Terms**.  
- Sellers are responsible for continuous monitoring to ensure compliance with these tolerance limits.

---

## Practical Meaning
When using Loan Selling Advisor®:
1. Entering loan data = *offer to sell*.  
2. Accepting Freddie Mac’s contract = *binding commitment*.  
3. Always monitor cumulative **UPB** against **Commitment Amount tolerances** to avoid breach of contract.
