Effective Date: 09/03/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section establishes **pooling and disclosure requirements** for Mortgages sold to Freddie Mac under the **Guarantor** and **MultiLender Swap** programs.  
The goal is to ensure that all securitized Mortgages are pooled with **homogeneity and transparency**, maintaining consistency in investor disclosures.

---

## (a) Fixed-Rate Guarantor Program (UMBS®)

Each **UMBS® or MBS Pool** issued under the fixed-rate Guarantor program must:

- Consist of **Mortgages from a single Seller**,  
- Represent an **undivided ownership interest** in those same Mortgages,  
- Bear interest at the **applicable Coupon**, and  
- Have an **original principal balance rounded down to the nearest dollar.**

### Additional Provisions:
- Sellers may deliver **15- or 30-year fixed-rate Mortgages** in exchange for **MBS with nonstandard Coupons** (not divisible by 0.5%).  
- Before selling such Mortgages, the Seller must obtain **written approval from Freddie Mac** by contacting their Freddie Mac representative or **Customer Service at 800-FREDDIE.**

---

## (b) MultiLender Swap Program

Each **UMBS® or MBS Pool** issued under the MultiLender Swap program must:

- Consist of **fixed-rate Mortgages** acquired by Freddie Mac from **one or more Sellers**,  
- Represent an **undivided interest** in the same Mortgages,  
- Bear interest at the **applicable Coupon**, and  
- Have an **original principal balance rounded down to the nearest dollar.**

> MultiLender Pools combine Mortgages from multiple Sellers, but all pooled loans must conform to Freddie Mac’s homogeneity and eligibility requirements.

## (c) WAC ARM Guarantor Program

Each **WAC ARM PC Pool** must:

- Contain **adjustable-rate Mortgages (ARMs)** acquired from a **single Seller**,  
- Represent an **undivided interest** in the same Mortgages, and  
- Conform to the applicable **WAC ARM pooling criteria** in Chapter 4401.
