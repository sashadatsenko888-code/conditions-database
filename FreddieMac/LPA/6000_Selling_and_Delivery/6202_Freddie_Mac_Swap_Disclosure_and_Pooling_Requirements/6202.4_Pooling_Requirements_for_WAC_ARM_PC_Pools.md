> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section establishes pooling and disclosure standards for **Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)** securitized as **WAC ARM PCs** under the **WAC ARM Guarantor program**.  
> Note: ARMs **cannot** be sold under the MultiLender Swap program.

---

## (a) Term Requirements
- ARMs must have **original terms ≤30 years (360 months)**.  
- Example: a 15-year ARM may be pooled with a 30-year ARM.  
- See §4201.3 for original maturity requirements.

---

## (b) Minimum Pool Size
- Each **WAC ARM PC Pool** must have an aggregate UPB of **≥$500,000**.

---

## (c) Minimum Contract Servicing Spread
- Must comply with **Servicing Spread requirements** in §6201.3(c).

---

## (d) Index Requirements
- All ARMs in the pool must adjust based on the **same Index**.  
- See §4401.1(b) for eligible ARM indices.

---

## (e) Lookback Period Requirements
- All ARMs must share the **same Lookback Period**.  
- See §4401.1(b) for Lookback details.

---

## (f) Initial Period Requirements
- All ARMs must have the **same Initial Period** (e.g., 3/6-month ARMs only with 3/6-month ARMs).  
- See §4401.1(a) for ARM product initial period definitions.

---

## (g) Periodic Adjustments
- The interval between periodic Note Rate changes must be **identical for all ARMs** in the pool.  
- See §4401.1(a) for specific periodic adjustment schedules.

---

## (h) Note Rate Adjustment Cap Requirements
| Cap Type | Requirement |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Initial Cap** | All ARMs must share the same Initial Cap |
| **Periodic Cap** | All ARMs must share the same Periodic Cap |
| **Life Cap** | May vary among Mortgages |

> See Exhibit 17S (Available Mortgage Products) for product-specific caps.

---

## (i) Assumability Feature
- All ARMs in the pool must be **assumable**, but assumability features **may differ**.  
- See §4101.9 for due-on-sale and assumability terms.

---

## (j) ARMs with Special Characteristics
- All ARMs in each WAC ARM PC Pool must have the **same features**.  
- **Extended Buydown Mortgages** may not exceed **10% UPB** of the total pool.  
- See §4204.3 (eligibility) and §6302.18 (delivery).
