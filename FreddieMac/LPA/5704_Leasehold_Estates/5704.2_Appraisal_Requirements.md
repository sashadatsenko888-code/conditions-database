## (a) General Appraisal Requirements
For every leasehold Mortgage, the **appraiser must**:

1. **Describe Lease Terms**  
   - Provide a detailed description of the lease terms, conditions, and restrictions.  
   - Analyze and report how these terms affect both the **value** and **marketability** of the Mortgaged Premises.

2. **Comparable Sales Analysis**
   - When possible, use **comparable leasehold sales** with the **same lease terms** as the subject property.  
   - If none are available, use leasehold sales with **different lease terms** and:  
     - Describe the differences, and  
     - Quantify or explain how those differences affect marketability and value.

3. **Substitute Fee-Simple Sales**
   - If no comparable leasehold sales exist, use **similar fee-simple sales** as comparables.  
   - The appraiser must:  
     - Justify why fee-simple comparables were necessary, and  
     - Make **appropriate market-based adjustments** for property rights differences.

## (b) Additional Requirements for Condominium and PUD Leaseholds
When the subject property is a **Condominium Unit** or **PUD Unit** located on a leasehold estate, the appraisal report must also:

- Provide a **description of the Common Elements**, including any shared **Amenities**.  
- Include **comments on the ground rent** for both:  
  - The subject property, and  
  - Comparable competing properties.  

These comments must evaluate how ground rent levels influence **marketability, affordability, and long-term value**.
