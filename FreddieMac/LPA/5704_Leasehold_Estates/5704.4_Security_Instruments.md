Effective Date: 06/04/2025

## Overview
This section specifies how the **Uniform Security Instrument** must document and reference a **leasehold interest** securing a Mortgage.

---

## (a) Description of Mortgaged Premises
The Uniform Security Instrument must:

- Clearly identify the **Mortgaged Premises** as a **leasehold interest**, and  
- State that this interest is created by a **recorded lease** covering the property described in the **legal description**.

This ensures the lien properly attaches to the Borrower’s leasehold rights in the underlying real estate.

---

## (b) Compliance with Authorized Changes
The Seller must also comply with:

> **Exhibit 5A – Authorized Changes to Notes, Riders, Security Instruments and the Uniform Residential Loan Application**,  
> **Section IV – Leasehold Estates**

This exhibit governs the specific authorized modifications and rider language that must be used when documenting leasehold estates in Freddie Mac-eligible Security Instruments.
