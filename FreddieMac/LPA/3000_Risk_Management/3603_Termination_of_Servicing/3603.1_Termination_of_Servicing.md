## ## Overview
Section 3603.1 outlines Freddie Mac’s authority to **terminate all or part of a Servicer’s Servicing Contract and related Servicing Contract Rights**, with or without cause.  
This section also specifies Servicer obligations, notice periods, compensation rules, transfer requirements, and consequences for breaches or disqualification.

Termination does **not** relieve the Servicer of reps & warranties or previously existing obligations.

## ## (a) Termination of Servicing Contracts and Related Servicing Contract Rights

Freddie Mac may terminate the Servicing Contract:

- **Entirely or partially**
- **At any time**
- **With cause OR without cause**

A partial termination does **not** prevent Freddie Mac from later terminating the remainder.

Freddie Mac may also require a **Servicing Agent** instead of terminating the contract.  
The Servicer must:

- Follow all Guide requirements  
- Fully implement the Servicing Agent within Freddie Mac’s timeframe  
- Pay all expenses related to using the Servicing Agent  

Even after termination or use of a Servicing Agent, the Servicer remains liable for **all Servicing representations & warranties** (see Section 8102.1).

Freddie Mac may choose any remedy or combination of remedies, and Transferor Servicer obligations do not end after a Transfer of Servicing.

### ### (i) Termination With Cause

Freddie Mac may terminate all or part of the Servicing Contract **with cause** for any reason listed in Section 2301.2 (disqualification/suspension).

Sections 2301.3–2301.6 apply (notice, appeal, etc.).

Termination with cause results in:

- Immediate disqualification or suspension  
- No right to continue Servicing  
- **No compensation** for Servicing  
- **No Termination Fee**

If Freddie Mac appoints a Transferee Servicer, the former Servicer must reimburse Freddie Mac for **transfer-related expenses**, including:

- Court costs  
- Attorney fees  
- Copying costs  
- Physical file transfer costs  
- Audit or exam costs (if required)

All transfer, document, and remittance requirements in Sections 3603.2(a), 3603.3(a), 3603.3(b) apply.

### ### (ii) Termination Without Cause

#### **(A) Notice Period + Servicer Right to Transfer**

Freddie Mac may terminate all or part of the Servicing Contract **without cause**.

Process:

- Freddie Mac gives **90 days written notice**
- During these 90 days, Servicer may arrange a Transfer of Servicing to a Freddie-Mac-approved Transferee Servicer
- Transfer must follow Chapter 7101
- If approval is granted → transfer must complete within **60 days after approval**
- If unsuccessful → Freddie Mac terminates and transfers to a Servicer of its choosing

---

#### **(B) Termination Fee**

If Freddie Mac terminates **without cause** and selects its own Transferee Servicer, it will pay a **Termination Fee**.

Fee equals the lesser of:

1. **2 × Net Servicing Rate × UPB** (only for *non-delinquent* loans)
2. **Market value** of the Servicing Contract as determined by an approved market valuation provider

Definitions:

- **Net Servicing Rate = Note Rate minus:**
  - pass-through rate  
  - any Credit Fee in Yield  
  - excess Servicing not retained  
  - lender-paid MI  
  - any other component not payable to Servicer  

Delinquency rule:

- A loan is delinquent if **any payment is outstanding**:
  - as of month-end of Effective Date of Transfer  
  - or month-end immediately prior for mid-month transfers  
- **No Termination Fee for delinquent loans**

Freddie Mac will deduct **transfer-related expenses** from the Termination Fee.

Before payment:

Servicer must:

- Complete **all repurchases** required under Chapter 3602
- Fulfill **all outstanding obligations**

If not, Freddie Mac offsets obligations against the Termination Fee.

Termination Fee is the **only** compensation; no further damages or claims allowed.

---

### ### (iii) Extinguishment of Rights in Collateral Related to Conveyance or Financing

Upon Termination (with or without cause):

- All prior Freddie Mac approvals of **Conveyances related to Financing** are automatically terminated  
- Approvals do **not** survive termination  
- Lender/cash-flow buyer has **no further interest in Collateral**, except:
  - Termination Fee interest (if any)  
  - Surplus Proceeds (if any)

Rights are conclusively extinguished.

## ## (b) Termination of Servicing Contract Related to Sale of Mortgages by Freddie Mac

If Freddie Mac sells Mortgages:

- Servicer receives at least **30 days notice** after bid acceptance and before closing

If **acquirer does NOT require** Servicing transfer:

- Servicer continues to service for the acquirer
- **No compensation** from Freddie Mac for post-sale servicing

If Servicing **is transferred**:

- Servicer receives Termination Fee (calculated as in 3603.1(a)(ii))

Transfer, documentation, and remittance requirements in Sections 3603.2(a), 3603.3(a), 3603.3(b) apply.
