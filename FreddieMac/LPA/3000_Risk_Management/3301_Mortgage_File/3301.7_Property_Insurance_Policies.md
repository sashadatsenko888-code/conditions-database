## Overview
This section outlines Freddie Mac’s documentation requirements for **property insurance policies** within the Mortgage file.  
It ensures that Seller/Servicers maintain evidence of adequate property insurance coverage for each Mortgaged Premises, consistent with Freddie Mac’s Servicing and collateral protection standards.

## Requirements

1. **Inclusion in Mortgage File:**  
   - The Mortgage file must contain **property insurance policies** that are:  
     - **Properly endorsed**, **or**  
     - Accompanied by other **suitable evidence of insurance** as defined in **Section 8202.4**.

2. **Acceptable Evidence of Insurance:**  
   - Suitable evidence may include, but is not limited to:  
     - A certificate or declaration page from the insurer,  
     - A policy endorsement naming Freddie Mac as mortgagee or loss payee,  
     - A digital confirmation of active policy status consistent with Freddie Mac’s e-servicing documentation standards.  
   - All evidence must clearly identify the insured property address and coverage terms.

3. **Mortgage Impairment Insurance Exception:**  
   - If the Seller/Servicer carries **Mortgage impairment insurance**, it may do so **in lieu of maintaining physical possession** of the individual property insurance policies.  
   - In this case, the Seller/Servicer must ensure that:
     - The impairment insurance policy provides coverage equal to or greater than Freddie Mac’s minimum requirements, and  
     - The policy terms comply with all applicable provisions in **Section 8202.4**.

4. **Retention and Accessibility:**  
   - All property insurance evidence must be maintained in the Mortgage file—either **physically or electronically**—and made available to Freddie Mac upon request.
