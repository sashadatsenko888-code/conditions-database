Section: 3301.4 – Assignment Instrument  
Effective Date: 05/01/2020  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview
This section defines Freddie Mac’s requirements for maintaining and handling **assignment instruments** within the Mortgage file.  
It specifies where **Intervening Assignments** must be held and the documentation obligations for Seller/Servicers, especially when Mortgages are registered with the **Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS®)**.

---

## Requirements

1. **Custody of Intervening Assignments:**  
   - All **Intervening Assignments** must be **sent to and held by the Document Custodian**, unless the Mortgage is registered with MERS® and the Seller/Servicer elects to retain them.  
   - This ensures Freddie Mac’s chain of title remains verifiable and properly documented.

2. **MERS-Registered Mortgages:**  
   - If the Mortgage is **registered with MERS®**, the Seller/Servicer may **retain all assignment instruments** in the Mortgage file **instead of sending them to the Document Custodian**, provided that:
     - The Seller/Servicer has **formally elected** this option, and  
     - Documentation of this election is included in the Mortgage file.

3. **Notification to Document Custodian:**  
   - The Seller/Servicer must supply the **Document Custodian** with written confirmation indicating that it has elected to retain all assignments for MERS-registered Mortgages.  
   - This confirmation must clearly state that the assignments are maintained internally in compliance with Freddie Mac’s requirements.

4. **Cross-Reference:**  
   - For additional details and procedural guidance, see **Section 6301.8** of the Freddie Mac Seller/Servicer Guide.
