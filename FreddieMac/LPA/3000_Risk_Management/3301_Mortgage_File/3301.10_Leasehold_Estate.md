Section: 3301.10 – Leasehold Estate  
Effective Date: 07/25/2018  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section specifies Freddie Mac’s documentation requirements for **leasehold estate Mortgages**.  
When a Mortgage is secured by a leasehold interest rather than a fee simple estate, all related lease documents must be properly included and verifiable within the Mortgage file.

---

## Requirements

1. **Applicability:**  
   - This requirement applies when the **Mortgaged Premises** are held under a **leasehold estate**, meaning the Borrower’s ownership interest is based on a long-term lease rather than outright property ownership.

2. **Required Documentation:**  
   - The Mortgage file must include **all documents affecting the leasehold estate**, including:
     - The **original executed lease**, or  
     - A **certified copy of the lease** that includes:
       - The **recordation information** (book, page, or document number), and  
       - Any **amendments, extensions, or renewals** that modify lease terms.

3. **Purpose:**  
   - These documents establish Freddie Mac’s security interest in the leasehold estate and confirm:
     - The Borrower’s lease rights,  
     - The lease term’s adequacy (per Freddie Mac minimum duration requirements), and  
     - The assignability and non-disturbance provisions required for enforceability.

4. **Retention:**  
   - The lease or certified copy must be maintained in the Mortgage file (paper or electronic) and be **readily accessible** for Freddie Mac review.
