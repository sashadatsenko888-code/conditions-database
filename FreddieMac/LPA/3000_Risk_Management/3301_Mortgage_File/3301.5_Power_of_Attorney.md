## Overview

It clarifies how the POA must be retained in the Mortgage file and references related sections for delivery procedures.

## Requirements

1. **Power of Attorney Attachment:**  
   - When the **Note** has been executed by an individual acting as **attorney-in-fact** for the Borrower under a valid **power of attorney**, the **copy of the POA** must be **attached to the copy of the Note** in the Mortgage file.  
   - This requirement applies to **all Mortgages except eMortgages**.

2. **Exemption for eMortgages:**  
   - For **eMortgages**, documentation and delivery requirements are governed separately under **Section 1402.8(a)**.

3. **Delivery and Recordkeeping:**  
   - For traditional (non-electronic) Mortgages, follow the documentation and delivery requirements described in **Section 6301.4**.  
   - The attached POA copy must clearly reference:
     - The Borrower’s name,  
     - The attorney-in-fact’s authority, and  
     - The specific transaction authorization related to execution of the Note.

4. **Record Retention:**  
   - The POA copy must remain **permanently associated** with the Note in all file versions (electronic or paper).  
   - The Seller/Servicer must ensure traceability in case of audits or servicing transfers.
