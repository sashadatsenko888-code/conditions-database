## Overview

Section 3402.2 outlines requirements for Sellers who outsource any portion of their in-house quality control (QC) program to **third-party QC providers**.  
Freddie Mac allows outsourcing, but the Seller **retains full responsibility** for compliance, performance oversight, and corrective actions.

Outsourcing QC **does not reduce or transfer** the Seller’s obligations under the Guide.
