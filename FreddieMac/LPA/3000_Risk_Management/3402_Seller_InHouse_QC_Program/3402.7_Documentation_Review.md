Section: 3402.7 – Documentation Review  
Effective Date: 11/05/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview

Section 3402.7 describes the scope of documentation review required for all Mortgages selected for **post-closing quality control (QC)**.  
The Seller must confirm legal compliance, underwriting eligibility, accuracy of closing documentation, and consistency of the Mortgage file compared to reverifications.

Sellers may optionally split the review into two separate samples—legal documentation vs. underwriting/eligibility documentation—if certain conditions are met.

---

# (a) Required Documentation Review Components

For all Mortgages in the QC sample, the Seller must review and affirm:

### 1. **Legal Compliance Documentation (Section 4202.1(a))**
- Existence and accuracy of documents needed to confirm compliance with all applicable laws  
- Includes HOEPA, HPML/HPCT thresholds, points and fees tests, and other regulatory safeguards  
- Must detect potential violations or high-cost triggers

### 2. **Eligibility & Underwriting Compliance**
Must confirm full compliance with:

- Seller’s underwriting requirements  
- Mortgage insurer (MI) requirements (if applicable)  
- Freddie Mac eligibility and underwriting guidelines  
- Seller’s warranty regarding Freddie Mac’s **Exclusionary List**  
- Closing requirements based on Settlement/Closing Disclosure and supporting documentation

### 3. **Closing Conditions**
- Review Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement  
- Confirm all closing conditions were fully satisfied

---

# Optional Split Review (Legal vs. Underwriting)

A Seller **may** perform:

- A legal compliance review on one QC sample  
- A separate underwriting/eligibility review on another QC sample

**Requirements:**

- The “legal sample” must include **at least as many loans** as required under Section 3402.4(a) (random sample rule)  
- If a legal issue is discovered in the underwriting sample, Seller must ensure a full legal compliance review is completed for that loan

### Additional Mandatory Checks (when splitting samples)

The Seller must ensure all Mortgages identified during underwriting review that:

- Might exceed **HOEPA** thresholds  
- Might meet definition of **HPML/HPCT**  
- Might exceed **points and fees** limitations (4202.2(c))  

→ receive full legal compliance review.

# Required Documents to Compare Against Reverifications

The Seller must include the following documents in QC review to ensure consistency with reverification results:

- **Form 65 – Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA)**  
- Credit documentation  
- Employment and income documentation  
- Asset documentation  
- Property valuation documentation  
- Sales contract  
- **Form 1077 – Uniform Underwriting and Transmittal Summary** (or LPA Feedback Certificate)
