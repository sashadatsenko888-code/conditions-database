## Overview

An effective QC program is expected to:

- Detect errors, misrepresentations, defects, or policy breaches  
- Provide actionable feedback to improve production processes  
- Reflect the operational realities and risk profile of the Seller  
- Support fraud prevention, detection, and reporting

- Geographic footprint  
- Branch structure  
- Mortgage volume and product mix  
- Origination channels (brokers, correspondents, retail, online)
