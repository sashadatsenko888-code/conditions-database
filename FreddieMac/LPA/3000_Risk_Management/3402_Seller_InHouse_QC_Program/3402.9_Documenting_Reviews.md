## Overview

Section 3402.9 establishes the Seller’s responsibility to **fully document all preclosing and post-closing quality control (QC) reviews**.  
This includes maintaining complete records and documenting all discrepancies that may affect Mortgage eligibility under Seller, MI, or Freddie Mac requirements.

---

## Documentation Requirements

The Seller must:

### 1. Maintain Complete QC Records  
For every Mortgage selected for:

- **Preclosing QC**, or  
- **Post-closing QC**

The Seller must maintain **complete and comprehensive records** that include:

- All reverifications  
- All documents reviewed  
- Notes, analysis, and QC reviewer findings  
- Evidence of defect resolution  
- Internal communications related to QC findings  
- Supporting documentation for any corrective action taken  

Records must be maintained in a way that clearly supports the QC conclusions.

---

### 2. Document & Explain All Discrepancies  
For any QC review (preclosing or post-closing), if the Seller identifies:

- Discrepancies  
- Inconsistencies  
- Conflicts in data  
- Missing documentation  
- Issues affecting eligibility

The Seller must:

- **Document** the discrepancy clearly  
- **Explain** the inconsistency  
- Identify its **impact on eligibility** under:
  - Seller requirements  
  - Mortgage insurer (MI) requirements  
  - Freddie Mac requirements  
- Document **how the defect was resolved** or why it did not impact eligibility

The documentation must be explicit enough for Freddie Mac to understand:

- What the issue was  
- Why it occurred  
- How it was resolved  
- Why the Mortgage remains (or does not remain) eligible
