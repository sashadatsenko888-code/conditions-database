Section: 3402.8 – Preclosing Quality Control Reviews  
Effective Date: 02/02/2022  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview

Section 3402.8 requires that the Seller’s quality control (QC) program include a **preclosing QC review process**.  
The purpose of these reviews is to:

- Detect and prevent closing of loans with defects  
- Ensure data accuracy  
- Validate adherence to origination policies  
- Identify fraud, misrepresentation, and insufficient documentation  
- Strengthen the reliability of data submitted to underwriting and Loan Product Advisor®  

Whenever operationally possible, preclosing QC must operate **independently** of origination and underwriting departments.

# (a) Preclosing QC Procedures

The Seller’s preclosing QC process should include procedures for:

### 1. Sample Selection & Timing  
- Ensure selected loans can be reviewed **before closing**  
- Allow sufficient time to identify and correct deficiencies  
- Avoid closing loans where the review is incomplete

### 2. Reporting & Corrective Action  
- Identify deficiencies through preclosing review  
- Report defects promptly  
- Implement corrective measures  
- Document the resolution of all defects

### 3. Settlement Decisions  
The Seller must have processes allowing it to:

- **Cancel** settlement  
- **Postpone** settlement  
- Delay closing when:
  - Deficiencies are found during review  
  - Preclosing review cannot be completed before scheduled closing

---

# (b) Sample Selection Requirements

The Seller’s preclosing QC sample should:

- Reflect the **full scope** of production as defined in Section 3402.4(a)  
  (all product types, branches, channels, states, risk characteristics)
- Be assessed regularly for effectiveness  
- Include **targeted samples** when needed, including to:

### 1. Review New Sources of Production  
- New branch offices  
- New employees  
- New third-party originators

### 2. Validate New Products  
- Verify new product offerings are originated according to Seller policies

### 3. Fraud-Related Targeting (per Section 3201.1(c))
- Review work of a specific employee or transaction participant  
- Required when there is **reason to suspect fraud**

---

# (c) Validation and Reverification

A strong preclosing QC review includes validation or reverification of:

- Data entered into **Loan Product Advisor®**  
- **Borrower Social Security number**, unless already validated during origination  
- **Income documentation** and **income calculation**  
- **Employment**  
- **Assets** required to close or meet reserve requirements  
- **Property valuation documentation** or valuation data  
- **Mortgage insurance** commitment and adequate coverage  
- Whether additional credit was obtained and considered if Borrower’s credit report shows **inquiries within 90 days**

Refer to Sections **3402.5** and **3402.7** for reverification exceptions.
