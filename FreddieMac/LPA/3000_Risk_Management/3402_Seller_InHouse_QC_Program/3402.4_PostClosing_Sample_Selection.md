## Overview

Section 3402.4 defines the **three mandatory sample types** that must be included in every Seller’s post-closing quality control (QC) program:

1. **Random Sample**  
2. **Targeted Sample**  
3. **Discretionary Sample**

These three categories ensure comprehensive file coverage based on risk, performance, and production characteristics.

---

## (a) Random Sample

### Requirements

The random QC sample must:

- Be selected so that **every Mortgage has an equal chance** of selection  
- Include a **representative portion** of Loan Product Advisor® (LPA) Mortgages  
- Cover at least **10%** of ONE of the following annual populations:
  - Total annual Home Mortgage production, **or**
  - Total annual secondary market Home Mortgage production, **or**
  - Total annual Freddie Mac Home Mortgage production  

**Important:**  
Any Mortgage **excluded** from the Seller’s QC selection process is **not eligible for sale to Freddie Mac**.

### Timing

- Sampling procedures must ensure that any Home Mortgage in the population may be selected for QC review within **90 days of the Note Date**.

### Authority & Coverage

- QC staff must have authority to conduct **additional reviews at their discretion**.  
- Over a rolling 12-month period, samples must be **representative of the full scope** of the Seller’s production, including:

  - All product lines  
  - All States of operation  
  - All branch offices  
  - All third-party origination sources  
  - High-risk Mortgage types (e.g., high LTV, ARMs, 3–4 units, Manufactured Homes, cash-out, Investment Property, Caution Mortgages)

### Statistically Based Alternative (Large Sellers)

Sellers with **> 5,000 Home Mortgages annually** may use a **statistical sampling methodology** if:

- Confidence level ≥ **95%**, AND  
- Margin of error ≤ **2%**,  
- Based on **recent QC defect rates**

---

## (b) Targeted Sample

Each month, the Seller must:

- Select a **risk-based sample** of Mortgages sold to Freddie Mac that become **60+ days delinquent in the first 6 months** after the Note Date  
- Review these Mortgages for:
  - **Fraud**
  - **Deficiencies**
  - **Manufacturing defects**

---

## (c) Discretionary Sample

Discretionary samples are:

- **Non-random selections**  
- Focused on a **specific loan characteristic, source, or underwriting component**

### Examples of Discretionary Focus Areas

- Income calculation  
- Employment reverification  
- Assets  
- Credit  
- Property valuation  
- Business source  
- New product lines  
- New branch office  
- New third-party originator

### Review Scope Requirements

The scope must match the intent:

- If focusing on **income calculations** → only income/employment reverifications required  
- If focusing on **new business source** → **all** reverifications required (per Section 3402.5)

### Fraud Requirement (Section 3201.1(c))

Discretionary samples **must** be pulled to investigate:

- A specific employee  
- A specific participant in the mortgage transaction  
- When there is a **reason to suspect fraud**

### Additional Required Uses

Discretionary sampling must also be used to:

- Review work from **new branch offices**  
- Review work from **new employees**  
- Validate proper origination of **new products or offerings**  
- Fulfill **Freddie Mac’s request** to review a specific population
