Section: 3402.6 – Data Integrity Review  
Effective Date: 02/02/2022  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview

Section 3402.6 establishes the requirement that the Seller’s post-closing quality control (QC) program must include a **data integrity review** for **every Mortgage** selected for QC sampling.

The intent is to confirm that:

- All loan data is **complete**, **accurate**, and **consistent**
- Data entered into Loan Product Advisor® (LPA) matches source documentation  
- Delivery data (including Key Number) is accurate  
- No discrepancies exist between origination documents and delivered loan data

This review must be documented and must rely on original source documents.

---

## Required Elements of the Data Integrity Review

### 1. Completeness & Accuracy Verification  
The Seller must:

- Review the completeness and accuracy of all information obtained during mortgage origination  
- Ensure that every data element used for underwriting and submission is properly supported  
- Confirm consistency across all systems, records, and documents

---

### 2. Loan Product Advisor® Data Validation

The review must include:

- Checking **all data fields entered into LPA**  
- Ensuring all submitted data is **valid** and **reflects the correct loan characteristics**  
- Ensuring that no clerical or system-entry errors occurred

---

### 3. Mandatory Review of Source Documentation

The Seller must review the following original/source documents:

- **Form 65 – Uniform Residential Loan Application**  
- Employment & income verifications  
- Sales contracts  
- Tax returns  
- Credit data  
- Asset documentation  
- Property valuation documentation  
- **Mortgage delivery data**, including:
  - ULDD/loan delivery file  
  - **Key Number**, when applicable

---

### 4. If QC Team Lacks Access to Delivery Data

If the QC business unit **does not have access** to delivery data (including Key Number):

- The Seller may assign another business area to conduct the delivery data portion, **only if**:
  - **Documented controls** are in place  
  - Controls must mitigate any risk of delivery data errors  
  - The QC program explicitly documents this arrangement
