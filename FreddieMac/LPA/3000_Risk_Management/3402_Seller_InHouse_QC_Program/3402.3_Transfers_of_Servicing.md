> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview

Section 3402.3 outlines the requirements for the Seller’s **post-closing quality control (QC) program** when Servicing is transferred.  
Even after a Servicing transfer, the Seller remains responsible for ensuring QC can be completed and that documentation is available.

The QC program must include written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of Servicing transfers.

## Requirements When Servicing Is Transferred

When a Transfer of Servicing occurs, the Seller must:

### 1. Retain Access to File Documents  
The Seller must either:

- **Retain copies** of all Mortgage file documents necessary to complete its QC reviews, **or**  
- Make **formal arrangements** with the new Servicer to provide assistance and access to required documents for QC reviews  

### 2. Provide QC Records to the New Servicer  
- Records of **completed post-closing QC reviews** must be provided to the new Servicer **upon request**.

This ensures that QC findings and remediation history remain available throughout the loan’s lifecycle.
