Section: 3401.2 – Credit Enhancer Postfunding Review  
Effective Date: 03/02/2016  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview

Section 3401.2 describes how **third-party credit enhancers** may request Mortgage information after Freddie Mac purchases a loan.  
It sets deadlines and cooperation requirements for the Seller or any transferee Servicer, explains that failure to cooperate can trigger Freddie Mac remedies, and confirms that such credit enhancer reviews **do not limit Freddie Mac’s own QC and remedies** or the Seller’s representations and warranties.

---

## Credit Enhancer Requests

Freddie Mac may obtain a **credit enhancement** on some or all Mortgages it purchases, either:

- At the same time it purchases the Mortgages, or  
- After the purchase.

When a credit enhancement is in place:

- The **Seller (as Servicer)** or any **transferee Servicer** may receive an **electronic request** from Freddie Mac to provide **Mortgage files or other Mortgage information or documentation** (“Mortgage information”) related to the credit-enhanced Mortgages.  
- Freddie Mac’s request will:
  - Identify the **credit enhancer** that is requesting the Mortgage information  
  - **Authorize** the release of specified Mortgage information to that credit enhancer  
  - Provide the **name and contact information** for the designated person at the credit enhancer to whom the information must be sent  

The Seller or transferee Servicer must send the requested Mortgage information **directly to the named credit enhancer contact**.

---

## Submission Deadlines

The Seller or any transferee Servicer must provide the requested Mortgage information by the earlier of:

- **30 days** after receiving Freddie Mac’s request, **or**  
- The **written deadline** agreed upon between the credit enhancer and the Seller or transferee Servicer.

Timely and accurate cooperation is mandatory.

---

## Cooperation and Consequences

For each request for Mortgage information:

- The Seller or transferee Servicer **is not entitled to notice** of any action taken by the credit enhancer as a result of its review.  
- If the Seller or transferee Servicer **fails to cooperate** with the credit enhancer and that failure **jeopardizes Freddie Mac’s ability to maintain the credit enhancement**, then Freddie Mac may exercise **any or all rights and remedies** available under:
  - The Seller’s Purchase Documents, or  
  - The transferee Servicer’s Purchase Documents, as applicable.

This can include remedies similar to those available for other types of noncompliance (up to and including repurchase or other contractual actions).

---

## Effect on Freddie Mac’s Rights and R&W

Requests for Mortgage information by a credit enhancer:

- **Do not modify, mitigate, or nullify** any of Freddie Mac’s rights under the Purchase Documents.  
- Do **not** limit Freddie Mac’s:
  - Right to conduct its **own quality control review** at any time in the future, or  
  - Right to **issue remedies** for any Mortgages Freddie Mac determines are ineligible.

Under Section 1301.10:

- The Seller’s **representations and warranties remain fully in effect**,  
- They are **not affected** by:
  - Any investigation or review performed by the credit enhancer, or  
  - Any subsequent investigation made by, or on behalf of, Freddie Mac.
