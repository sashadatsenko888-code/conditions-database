---

## Overview
Section 3401.1 outlines Freddie Mac’s **postfunding quality control (QC) requirements** for all Mortgages sold to Freddie Mac.  
It defines key QC terminology, establishes the Seller/Servicer’s obligations for file submission, explains defect categories and corrective procedures, and specifies possible outcomes from Freddie Mac’s postfunding review.

---

## (a) Defined Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Component Based Review** | Partial postfunding QC review of specific loan components (not a full-file review). |
| **Correction** | Seller/Servicer’s documentation or action showing a Significant Defect either did not exist or has been corrected. |
| **Counterparty Status** | Freddie Mac’s assessment of a Seller/Servicer’s financial condition used to determine eligible Remedies. |
| **Defect** | A loan-level deficiency violating the Purchase Documents effective at the time of sale. |
| **De Minimis Correction** | Minor correction ≤ $500 resolving a defect, unless it affects Borrower minimum contributions or violates the Charter Act. |
| **Price-Adjusted Loan (PAL)** | Mortgage that would have been eligible had correct data and Credit Fees been delivered at sale. |
| **Remedy** | An action (repurchase or Repurchase Alternative) to resolve a Significant Defect. |
| **Repurchase Alternative** | Non-repurchase resolutions such as indemnification, make-whole payments, or recourse agreements. |
| **Significant Defect** | Material defect that changes purchase price, affects eligibility, or breaches key underwriting, property, or legal requirements. |

## (b) General Quality Control Policy

Freddie Mac reserves the right to perform **postfunding reviews** (component-based or full-file) on any sold Mortgage.  
Each review confirms that the Mortgage:

- Meets **investment quality standards** (Section 4201.1).  
- Demonstrates the **Borrower’s creditworthiness** and repayment capacity.  
- Is **adequately secured by collateral**.  
- **Complies** with all underwriting, purchase, and anti-predatory lending requirements.

Freddie Mac’s determinations are **conclusive**, unless the Seller/Servicer elects the **Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR)** process under Section 3602.8.

---

## (c) FICO® Scores

Freddie Mac uses **FICO scores** and accompanying reason codes when selecting loans for review.  
If the Seller delivered an **Indicator Score** in compliance with Section 5202.1, Freddie Mac will use that score.

---

## (d) Reviewing “Accept” Mortgages

For **Accept Mortgages** under Loan Product Advisor®:
- Freddie Mac accepts Borrower creditworthiness as valid if:
  - All required information was submitted accurately and documented.  
  - The Seller complied fully with all applicable LPA and Guide terms.  
- No additional credit review will be performed in postfunding QC.

---

## (e) Mortgage File Submission Requirements

Upon notice from Freddie Mac, the Seller/Servicer must submit the **complete Mortgage file** for review, including:

- Credit, income, employment, collateral, and asset documentation.  
- All documents listed in Sections 3401.3–3401.30, as applicable.  
- Indicator Score source documentation.  
- Any other Mortgage-related documents requested.  

Additional requirements:
- **Nonperforming loans** must include records of collection efforts, workouts, property inspections, and foreclosure logs.  
- Files must be delivered electronically per Freddie Mac’s QC specifications:

Freddie Mac may impose a **noncompliance fee** for improper formats or manual processing.

### Submission Deadlines
- Mortgage files must be received **within 30 days** of request.  
- Failure to comply may result in a **repurchase request**, **suspension**, or **disqualification**.  
- Offering to repurchase a loan **does not exempt** the Seller from submitting the file.

---

## (f) Process for Remedying Selling and Origination Defects

### 1. Identification of Findings, PALs, and Significant Defects
After review, Freddie Mac categorizes each issue as:
- **Finding** — Minor data issue; no remedy required.  
- **PAL** — Credit Fee adjustment; repurchase not allowed.  
- **Significant Defect** — Requires repurchase or Repurchase Alternative.

### 2. Correcting Significant Defects
During the appeal (IDR) process:
- The Seller/Servicer may provide **Corrections** based on information available **at or before the Note Date**.  
- Acceptable Corrections include documentation that resolves property, flood, or mortgage insurance issues.  
- If corrections fully resolve all Significant Defects, Freddie Mac will **rescind** the Remedy request.

### 3. Freddie Mac Reassessment
- Freddie Mac re-underwrites the loan after receiving Corrections.  
- If Defects remain, the Seller/Servicer must complete the Remedy or pay applicable Credit Fees for any resulting PAL.

### 4. Range of Outcomes

| Category | Outcome | Relief from Representations & Warranties |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| **Finding** | No remedy required; may require data update | Granted if Full-File Review completed |
| **PAL** | Pay Credit Fee or rescind request | Granted upon payment after Full-File Review |
| **Significant Defect** | Repurchase, Repurchase Alternative, or rescission | Granted once all defects corrected or Remedy fulfilled |

Freddie Mac may offer or reject Repurchase Alternatives based on **Counterparty Status** or **past loan quality performance**.

If multiple Significant Defects exist, Freddie Mac may still pursue repurchase until all are corrected.

---

### Enforcement

Failure to submit Mortgage files for review or to comply with Remedy requests allows Freddie Mac to:
- **Demand repurchase**, or  
- **Invoke contractual and legal remedies**,  
unless an IDR outcome supersedes Freddie’s determination.
