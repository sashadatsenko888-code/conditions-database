Section: 3602.4 – Appeal and Dispute Resolution Processes  
Effective Date: 11/19/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## ## Overview
Section 3602.4 outlines **appeal rights, escalation mechanisms, and independent dispute resolution (IDR)** available to Seller/Servicers when Freddie Mac issues:

- a **Repurchase Demand** (selling/origination defects), or  
- a **Servicing Repurchase Alternative** / **Servicing Repurchase Demand** (servicing defects).

This section defines the sequence of escalation (Appeal → Impasse → Management Escalation → IDR), timelines, what documentation must be included, and when appeal rights terminate.

Freddie Mac’s remedies **survive** any repurchase and remain enforceable even after file review.

---

## ## (a) Survival of Remedies
- Freddie Mac’s election to allow or require repurchase **does not waive** other rights.  
- Freddie Mac may still:  
  - suspend, terminate, or disqualify the Seller/Servicer;  
  - terminate servicing rights;  
  - escalate action under Chapters **2301** and **3603**.  
- If Freddie Mac later discovers material discrepancies in a repurchased loan file, Freddie Mac may pursue **additional enforcement actions**.

---

## ## (b) Appeals of Repurchase Demands — Selling & Origination Defects

### ### (i) First Appeal
**Deadline:** 60 days from Repurchase Demand (or other timeframe defined by Freddie Mac).

  - repurchase within **15 days**, or  
  - proceed to the **second appeal** (if new information exists).

**Loss of rights:**

**If denied:**

**Impasse period:** 30 days (unless extended mutually).

**Outcomes:**  
- If parties agree no breach → Freddie Mac withdraws the Repurchase Demand.  
- If parties agree breach exists → Seller/Servicer implements remedy.  
- If disagreement persists → Seller/Servicer may initiate **Management Escalation Process**.

**If management escalation is not initiated within 15 days → all dispute rights terminate.**

**Availability:** only for loans with Settlement Dates ≥ **01/01/2016**.

## ## (c) Appeals of Repurchase / Repurchase Alternatives — Servicing Violations

### ### General Notes
These apply when Freddie Mac issues:  
- a **Servicing Repurchase Demand**, or  
- a **Servicing Repurchase Alternative**.

If deadlines are missed → appeal rights terminate, and payment is due.

---

### ### (i) Appeal Process (Servicing)
**Deadline:** 60 days to submit first appeal.

Appeal package must include:
- Full factual statement on servicing activities.  
- Justification for reversing Freddie Mac’s decision.  
- Supporting documentation.

**If denied:**
- Must remit payment within 15 days, or  
- Submit second appeal if new material evidence exists, or  
- Proceed to Impasse Process.

Freddie Mac must respond within **60 days** of receipt of each appeal.

If no first appeal is submitted → all escalation rights are lost.

If Freddie Mac later determines the defect is correctable, the Servicing Remedy letter is withdrawn and replaced with **Notice of Servicing Defect**.

---

### ### (ii) Escalation Processes — Servicing

#### #### (A) Impasse Process
- Must be initiated within 15 days of appeal denial.  
- 30-day impasse period.  
- Both parties attempt to resolve dispute.  
- Servicer may submit **Servicing Correction** anytime.

**Outcomes:**  
- No defect → remedy letter withdrawn.  
- Defect correctable → remedy letter withdrawn; Freddie Mac issues Notice of Servicing Defect.  
- Defect exists → remedy stands; Servicer must perform it.

If not escalated to Management Escalation Process within 15 days → all rights terminate.

---

#### #### (B) Management Escalation Process
**Deadline:** 15 days from Freddie Mac reaffirmation.

- Senior officers attempt resolution.  
- No new documentation allowed.  
- Escalation period: 30 days.

**If unresolved:**  
Servicer must initiate **IDR** within 15 days.

Failure to initiate IDR → rights terminate.

---

### ### (iii) IDR Process (Servicing)

- repurchase remedy amount  
- Servicing Repurchase Alternative amount  
- any non-loan-level issues

**Requirements:**
- Must follow Appeal → Impasse → Management Escalation first.  
- Must initiate within 15 days after management escalation.  
- Tolling agreement must be executed within 7 days.  
- No new documentation allowed.

---

## ## (d) Other Considerations
- Servicer may propose a **Servicing Repurchase Alternative** at any time.  
- Freddie Mac may accept or deny based on:  
  - Servicer Counterparty Status  
  - operational quality  
  - compliance history  
- Failure to appeal or remit payment → Freddie Mac may pursue **repurchase** or additional remedies.
