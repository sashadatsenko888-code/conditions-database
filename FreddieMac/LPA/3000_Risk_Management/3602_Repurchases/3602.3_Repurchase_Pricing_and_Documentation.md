Effective Date: 11/19/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section – Include in Ruleset if pricing or repurchase logic is needed**

---

## ## Overview
Section 3602.3 describes **how Freddie Mac calculates repurchase pricing** for Active, Inactive, and REO/post-foreclosure Mortgages, and outlines documentation and reporting requirements for all repurchases.

This Section applies after a Repurchase Demand is issued under Section 3602.2.

---

## ## (a) Repurchase Pricing

Repurchase pricing depends on the Mortgage status:

---

### ### (i) Active Mortgages  
Active Mortgage = Current or delinquent loan for which Servicer reports and Freddie Mac drafts payments/payoffs.

**Repurchase Price =**

- **UPB** (including any Negative Amortization on ARM)  
**PLUS**  
- **Accrued interest** at the *applicable net yield rate*  
  - From the **1st day of the month of repurchase**  
  - Through **day before repurchase**

---

### ### (ii) Inactive Mortgages  
A Mortgage becomes *inactive* when it hits **120+ days delinquency** (four payments past due).

**Repurchase Price =**

- **UPB**, including any Negative Amortization  
**PLUS**  
- **Accrued interest** at applicable net yield rate  
  - From **DDLPI** through **day before repurchase**  
**PLUS**  
- **Expenses reimbursed by Freddie Mac to Servicer**  
**PLUS**  
- **Other foreclosure or liquidation costs incurred by Freddie Mac or Servicer**  
**MINUS**  
- **Any MI proceeds, sale proceeds, rents, refunds, or other recoveries remitted to Freddie Mac**

---

### ### (iii) REO & All Post-Foreclosure Situations  
Includes REO, deed-in-lieu, or any post-foreclosure condition.

**Repurchase Price =**

- **UPB** as of acquisition or deed-in-lieu date  
  (incl. Negative Amortization)  
**PLUS**  
- **Accrued interest** calculated in two phases:

| Period | Interest Rate |
|-------|----------------|
| DDLPI → earlier of (repurchase due date –1) OR 150th day from DDLPI | **Accounting Net Yield (ANY)** |
| 151st day from DDLPI → earlier of (repurchase due date –1) OR 60 days after REO sale settlement | **Average prime rate (prior month) – 0.5%** |

**PLUS**  
- Reimbursed Servicer expenses  
- Costs of acquisition, maintenance, rehab, disposition  
- Incentives or below-market financing costs (if any)  
- G&A allocations  
- Other REO/foreclosure/liquidation costs  
- Cost of advancing payments on the same two-tier rate schedule as above  

**MINUS**  
- MI proceeds, sale proceeds, rental income, refunds, other recoveries

---

### ### Additional Freddie Mac Discretion  
Repurchase price **may include**:

- **Premium Freddie Mac paid** or  
- **Guarantor program premium adjustment**, based on market conditions at Settlement Date  
- **Buyup proceeds** previously paid to the Seller  
- **Loss, damages, attorney fees, court costs** incurred by Freddie Mac

---

### ### Timing & Late Fees  

- Funds OR appeal (per 3602.4(b)/(c)) must be submitted **within 60 days** of the repurchase letter.
- If no appeal within 60 days → repurchase is **deemed accepted**.
- Late remittance or delayed payoff reporting may trigger:

  - **Draft delay fee**  
  - **Interest = highest WSJ prime rate (last business day of month due) + 3%**  

Fees appear on the **Seller Account Activity Statement** and are drafted via ACH (per 6303.2(a)).

See Section **8303.5(h)** for draft delay fee calculations.

---

## ## (b) Documenting and Reporting Repurchases

The Seller/Servicer must:

- Document **all repurchases** in the Mortgage file  
- Maintain documentation for Freddie Mac review  
- For repurchases enabling Transfer of Ownership (3602.2(b)), retain documents required under **8406.3(a)**  

**Voluntary repurchases require prior written approval from Freddie Mac** unless initiated by Freddie Mac via written demand.

Repurchase is **NOT completed** until:

- Reporting and remittance requirements in **Section 8303.3(f)** are satisfied.
