This section describes the process for identifying Servicing Defects, issuing notices, and enforcing remedies.

---

## **(i) Process for Remediating Servicing Violations and Related Servicing Defects**

### **1. Notice of Servicing Defect vs. Servicing Remedy Letter**

Freddie Mac may issue:

#### **Notice of Servicing Defect**
Used when the defect **can be corrected** by the Servicer.

#### **Servicing Remedy Letter**  
Issued when:
- The defect is **uncorrectable**,  
- Or the Servicing Correction period ended without resolution,  
- Or the defect caused/will cause Freddie Mac losses.

##### **Uncorrectable Servicing Defects include:**
- Lien/security interest extinguished or inadequate,
- Irreparable property damage / uninhabitable property,
- Non-compliant foreclosure sale, short sale, or deed-in-lieu,
- Loss of insurance claim recoverability,
- Property not preserved/maintained, requiring REO repairs.

---

### **Servicing Repurchase Alternative Demand Letter**
Issued for Servicing Defects **not classified as Servicing Repurchase Defects**.

Freddie Mac must issue the letter within:
- **60 days** after the Servicing Correction period ends  
  (unless an extension notice is provided).

---

### **Repurchase Demand**
Issued for **Servicing Repurchase Defects** only.

Includes:
- Active loans,
- Inactive loans,
- REO and post-foreclosure situations.

If multiple Servicing Defects exist, Freddie Mac may issue either:
- One Repurchase Demand (if any defect meets Repurchase-Defect category), or
- One Servicing Repurchase Alternative demand covering all defects.

---

### **Contents of Notices**
Each notice includes:

| Notice Type | Required Content |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Notice of Servicing Defect** | Specific Servicing Violation(s); Servicing Correction period. |
| **Servicing Repurchase Alternative Letter** | Amount owed + detailed calculation; time frame to pay; appeal rights. |
| **Repurchase Demand** | Repurchase price calculation per 3602.3(a); timelines; appeal rights. |

---

## **2. Servicing Corrections**

During the Servicing Correction period:
- Servicer must correct all defects by the deadline.

After the period:
- Freddie Mac reviews the correction.

If accepted:
- No repurchase is required, but a **Servicing Repurchase Alternative** may still be charged if losses occurred.

A Servicer may attempt a correction after a Servicing Remedy letter is issued, but:
- After appeals/impasse, **no further corrections** will be considered.

---

## **3. Appeals of Servicing Remedy Letters**
All remedy letters are appealable per Section 3602.4(c).
