> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s requirements for **detecting, documenting, and reporting fraud, suspected fraud, and other suspicious activity** throughout the lifecycle of a Mortgage.  
It defines procedures, timeframes, and tools to ensure Seller/Servicers notify Freddie Mac promptly and accurately when potential fraud or misconduct is identified.

---

## (a) Procedures for Reporting and What to Report
Seller/Servicers must implement a **written program** with documented procedures to detect, identify, and report fraud, suspected fraud, or other suspicious activity in connection with any Mortgage sold to, or serviced for, Freddie Mac.  
This applies to all stages of origination, Servicing, quality control, and loss mitigation.

Reports must be made when the Seller/Servicer has a **reasonable belief** that any of the following has occurred:

1. **Borrower Misrepresentation:**  
   False statements or omissions about identity, employment, income, assets, debts, or occupancy.

2. **Property Misrepresentation:**  
   False or misleading information about property value, condition, or use.

3. **Transaction Misrepresentation:**  
   Undisclosed incentives, non–arm’s-length transactions, false purpose statements, or kickbacks.

4. **Involvement of Prohibited Parties:**  
   - A person or entity on the **Freddie Mac Exclusionary List** (Section 3101.1).  
   - A person or entity on the **FHFA Suspended Counterparty Program list** (Section 3101.2).

5. **Insurance Fraud:**  
   Termination or denial of mortgage insurance based on fraud.

Before reporting, the Seller/Servicer must conduct sufficient **due diligence** to confirm that a reasonable basis exists to conclude fraud or suspicious activity may have occurred.  

They must maintain records of:
- Fraud types and trends,  
- Confirmed and suspected cases, and  
- Positive Exclusionary List matches.  

Records must be retained under the Seller/Servicer’s internal retention policies and provided to Freddie Mac upon request.

---

## (b) Reporting Within 30 Days
If misrepresentation, misstatement, or omission affects the eligibility of a Mortgage sold to Freddie Mac:

- **Discovered during a QC review:**  
  Report within **30 days** after QC results are delivered in writing to senior management (per Section 3402.10).  

- **Discovered outside QC:**  
  Report within **30 days** of discovery.

All such activity must be reported using **Freddie Mac’s Tip Referral Tool**, available through Freddie Mac Gateway.

---

## (c) Immediate Notification and Reporting
Seller/Servicers must notify Freddie Mac **within one business day** after any of the following events:

1. Theft of custodial funds, collateral loss, or non-remittance of payoffs.  
2. Likely significant public exposure of a fraud event.  
3. Civil judgment, guilty plea, or conviction related to integrity or fraud involving a Mortgage participant or Seller/Servicer personnel.  
4. Notice of investigation or prosecution by a law enforcement or governmental authority related to Freddie Mac Mortgages or the Seller/Servicer.  
5. Discovery of a **fraud pattern or scheme** involving more than five Mortgages or $1 million UPB in aggregate.  
6. Identification of **terrorist financing** or **money laundering activity**.

Immediate reports must be submitted through the **Tip Referral Tool**.

Seller/Servicers must **not disclose** Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) or any related confidential documents to Freddie Mac, nor reveal whether a SAR was filed.

---

## (d) Use of the Tip Referral Tool
All Mortgage fraud, suspected fraud, and other suspicious activities must be reported via the **Tip Referral Tool**.  
Each referral must include at minimum:

- Freddie Mac loan number  
- Property address  
- Fraud or Suspicious Activity category  
- Parties involved  
- Supporting documentation  
- Narrative description explaining the basis for suspicion  
- Any other data fields required by the tool  

Personal information such as Social Security numbers must **not** be included in narrative descriptions.
