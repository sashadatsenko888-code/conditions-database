## Overview
This section outlines Freddie Mac’s minimum requirements for **fraud prevention and detection** across all stages of mortgage origination and Servicing.  
Seller/Servicers must maintain comprehensive practices, policies, and internal controls to identify, prevent, and report fraudulent activity in connection with Freddie Mac Mortgages and related real estate transactions.

Freddie Mac also encourages the implementation of additional, proactive anti-fraud measures beyond these minimum standards.

---

## (a) Hiring and Training
Seller/Servicers must implement **screening and hiring practices** designed to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of employees and contractors.  
All employees and any individuals or entities engaged to perform mortgage-related functions must receive **fraud awareness training** that includes:

- Common and emerging fraud schemes  
- Red flags indicating possible fraud and the need for further review  
- Procedures for preventing, detecting, and reporting suspected fraud  

Training must:
- Be updated at least **annually** to reflect emerging risks.  
- Be provided directly by the Seller/Servicer, a third party, or verified annually in writing if provided by another qualified source.  
- Be extended to contract personnel, including underwriters, processors, quality control firms, borrower outreach services, loss mitigation providers, and collection agencies.

## (b) Origination and Servicing
Seller/Servicers must take proactive steps to identify and investigate suspicious activity during origination and Servicing.  
At a minimum, they must:

1. **Escalate and investigate** any fraud indicators received from borrowers, transaction participants, or third parties.  
2. **Investigate Servicing-related red flags**, including suspicious loss mitigation activities, loan modifications, foreclosures, deeds-in-lieu, and short sales.  
3. **Monitor unusual patterns**, such as early payment defaults or inconsistent documentation.  
4. **Comply with Section 3101.1** regarding screening through the Freddie Mac Exclusionary List.  
5. **Adhere to all other Guide provisions** concerning fraud prevention and detection.

### Examples of Red Flags

**Origination:**
- Collateral or appraisal fraud (flipping, flopping, over/undervaluation, misrepresentation of condition)  
- Borrower misrepresentation (income, employment, liabilities, occupancy)  
- Identity theft  
- False or inconsistent documentation (forged signatures, fabricated statements)

**Servicing:**
- Suspicious payment activity (unverified funds, structured payments, reversals)  
- Loan modification or foreclosure scams  
- Debt elimination schemes or sovereign citizen claims  
- Suspicious or fraudulent payoff patterns  

Seller/Servicers must also **vet and monitor** their counterparties:
- **Sellers** must approve, evaluate, and monitor brokers, correspondents, service providers, and appraisers.  
- **Servicers** must approve, evaluate, and monitor all third parties performing Servicing functions, including those handling foreclosures, deeds-in-lieu, or short sales.

## (c) Seller/Servicer Quality Control Program
An effective in-house **Quality Control (QC) program** is a critical element of fraud prevention.  
Seller/Servicers must:

- Use discretionary sampling to review employee or participant work when fraud is suspected.  
- Target and sample loans to detect early payment defaults, data inconsistencies, or other red flags.  
- Update QC policies regularly to reflect new fraud trends and risks.  
- Maintain audit trails documenting findings and remediation actions.
