## Overview
This section summarizes Freddie Mac’s obligations under the **FHFA Suspended Counterparty Program (SCP)**.  
It outlines Seller/Servicer responsibilities to ensure that no individuals or entities listed on the FHFA SCP list (“Named Parties”) participate in any capacity connected to the origination, underwriting, or Servicing of Freddie Mac Mortgages.

---

## (a) FHFA Requirements
The **Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)** maintains the **Suspended Counterparty Program (SCP)** and requires Freddie Mac to **refrain from or cease doing business** with any Named Party listed under the program, subject to the terms of the relevant suspension order.

---

## (b) Seller/Servicer Requirements
Freddie Mac requires all **Seller/Servicers** to:
- Establish and maintain written **procedures** to prevent employing or contracting with Named Parties.  
- Ensure these procedures cover **all functions directly related** to the origination, underwriting, or Servicing of Freddie Mac Mortgages.  
- Apply any **specific conditions or exclusions** stated in each Named Party’s final suspension order.

---

## (c) Restrictions on Transactions
A Seller may **not sell** any Mortgage to Freddie Mac, and a Servicer may **not engage** in any Servicing activity involving a Named Party that is a required signatory on any of the following:
- **Note**  
- **Security Instrument**  
- **Modification agreement**  
- **Deed of sale** (including short sales or third-party transactions)  
- **Servicing-related contracts**

All prohibitions are **subject to exceptions** explicitly stated in the relevant Named Party’s suspension order.

---

## (d) Monitoring and Compliance
Seller/Servicers must regularly review:
- The **FHFA SCP List**, and  
- The associated **final suspension orders**,  
published on FHFA’s official website:

They are responsible for ensuring that internal controls remain current and effective.
