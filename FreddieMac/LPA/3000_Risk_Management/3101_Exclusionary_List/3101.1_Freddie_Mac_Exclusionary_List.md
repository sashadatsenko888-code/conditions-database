Section: 3101.1 – Freddie Mac Exclusionary List  
Effective Date: 10/13/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section describes Freddie Mac’s policies and requirements governing the **Freddie Mac Exclusionary List** — a confidential internal list identifying individuals and entities that pose risks to Freddie Mac.  
Parties on the Exclusionary List are prohibited from participating in the origination, sale, underwriting, processing, or Servicing of Freddie Mac Mortgages.

---

## (a) Purpose
Freddie Mac maintains the Exclusionary List to **protect the integrity** of its Mortgage purchase and Servicing operations.  
Names are added at Freddie Mac’s discretion when conduct presents risks such as fraud, misrepresentation, or lack of business integrity.

---

## (b) Use of the Exclusionary List
Sellers and Servicers must use the Exclusionary List **only** for approved compliance purposes:

1. **Mortgage Origination Screening:**  
   Before selling a Mortgage to Freddie Mac, Sellers must confirm that none of the following parties are listed:
   - Borrowers or property sellers  
   - Mortgage loan originators, brokers, or correspondents  
   - Real estate agents and agencies  
   - Settlement agents or companies  
   - Appraisers and appraisal companies  
   If any such party appears on the Exclusionary List, the Mortgage is **ineligible for sale**.

2. **Operational Staff Screening:**  
   The Seller/Servicer must verify that none of its employees or third-party contractors performing **sales, processing, underwriting, quality control, or Servicing functions** for Freddie Mac Mortgages appear on the Exclusionary List.  
   - New hires must be screened upon employment and **at least twice annually**.  
   - Buyers in **short sale transactions** must also be verified as not listed.

---

## (c) Placement on the List
Freddie Mac generally provides written notice before placement but may act immediately if warranted.  
Grounds for placement include (without limitation):
- Fraud or misrepresentation  
- Theft or fund misappropriation  
- Willful regulatory violations  
- Deficient business controls or practices  
- Conduct that demonstrates lack of integrity or poses risk to Freddie Mac  

Freddie Mac makes the final decision after review of any response from the individual or entity.

---

## (d) Seller Warranties
The Seller represents and warrants that:
- No person or entity on the Exclusionary List participated in origination or sale of any Mortgage sold to Freddie Mac.  
- No listed party was involved in underwriting, processing, or Servicing functions.  
- Adequate **internal controls and documentation** are maintained to prove compliance.

---

## (e) Seller Waiver
A Seller may request a **waiver** of these warranties before the Funding Date by contacting:  
📧 **EList_Confirmation@FreddieMac.com**  

Freddie Mac may grant a waiver at its sole discretion after review.  
If approved, Freddie Mac provides written notice, and the specific warranty is deemed waived for that transaction only.

---

## (f) Servicer Warranties
The Servicer represents and warrants that:
- No individual or entity on the Exclusionary List performs Servicing or quality control functions.  
- Buyers in short sale transactions are not listed.  
- Adequate control and documentation are maintained to ensure compliance.

---

## (g) Servicer Waiver
A Servicer must request written waiver **before engaging in** any transaction that would otherwise violate the warranties above.  
Requests must be sent to **EList_Confirmation@FreddieMac.com**.  
Freddie Mac may grant or deny at its sole discretion.

---

## (h) Reporting Obligations
If a Seller or Servicer discovers any potential violation of Exclusionary List warranties, it must **immediately report** the issue to  
📧 **EList_Confirmation@FreddieMac.com**

---

## (i) Confidentiality and Use
The Exclusionary List is **Freddie Mac Confidential Information** under Section 1201.8.  
- The list may only be used as permitted in this section.  
- Disclosure or unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.  
- The Seller/Servicer must indemnify Freddie Mac for any breach of confidentiality.

---

## (j) Access
The Exclusionary List is updated **at least monthly** and available through **Freddie Mac Gateway**.  
Sellers/Servicers must:
- Use only the most current version.  
- Obtain authorized credentials for access.  
- Contact **800-FREDDIE** or their account representative for support.

---

## (k) Remedies
Freddie Mac may exercise **any remedy available** under the Purchase Documents for violations, including:
- Suspension or termination of Seller/Servicer  
- Mortgage repurchase  
- Other enforcement actions as deemed necessary
