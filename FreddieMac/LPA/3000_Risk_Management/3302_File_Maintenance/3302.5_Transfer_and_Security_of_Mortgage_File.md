> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines the requirements for **transferring, securing, and maintaining custody** of Mortgage files and related documents.  
It establishes the Servicer’s duty to protect Freddie Mac’s property, ensure data confidentiality, and guarantee document retrieval upon request.

---

## 1. Freddie Mac’s Right to Request File Transfer
Freddie Mac may, at any time, require the Servicer to deliver any or all of the following to:
- A **Freddie Mac–approved Document Custodian**, or  
- A **transferee designated by Freddie Mac**.

Required deliverables include:
- **Original Notes, Security Instruments, assignments, and modification instruments** in Servicer custody.  
- **Mortgage files, documents, or related records** (whether originals or copies, as allowed under Section 3302.2).

---

## 2. Custody Entrustment Rules
- The Servicer **may entrust custody** of all or part of the Mortgage file to its **Document Custodian** (as referenced in Section 2202.2) **without prior approval** from Freddie Mac.  
- When requested, the Servicer must:
  - Identify all file items held by the Document Custodian.  
  - Provide documentation confirming the Custodian’s acknowledgment that such items:
    1. **Belong to Freddie Mac** (Freddie Mac is the owner of record).  
    2. Are **maintained according to Freddie Mac’s standards** (security, integrity, and accessibility).  
    3. Are **protected from unauthorized access**, loss, or corruption.  
    4. **Will be surrendered** immediately upon Freddie Mac’s request.

---

## 3. Indemnification Obligation
The Servicer must **indemnify and hold Freddie Mac harmless** from:
- Any **loss, damage, or expense**, including **court costs and attorney fees**,  
  that arise due to the Document Custodian’s handling or custody of the Mortgage file.  

This clause ensures Freddie Mac faces no liability for third-party custody errors.

---

## 4. Copy Retention Requirement
The Servicer must maintain a **copy** (paper or electronic, as permitted under Section 3302.2) of any **original document** entrusted to the Document Custodian.

---

## 5. Document Retrieval Obligation
If Freddie Mac requests **any original Mortgage file item** held by the Document Custodian (for quality control, audit, or servicing review), the Servicer must:
- **Retrieve it at its own expense**, and  
- **Deliver it promptly** to Freddie Mac in the location and time frame specified.
