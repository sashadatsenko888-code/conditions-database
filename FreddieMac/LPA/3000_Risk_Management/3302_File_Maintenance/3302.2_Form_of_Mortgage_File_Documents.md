## Overview
This section defines how **Servicers must store, protect, and reproduce Mortgage file documents**, covering paper originals, electronic copies, and hybrid electronic storage systems.  
It ensures compliance with Freddie Mac’s documentation integrity standards, electronic recording rules, and long-term retention obligations.

---

## (a) Paper Originals
The Servicer must maintain **paper originals** for specific document types that establish Freddie Mac’s security interest or legal rights.

### Required Paper Originals
1. **Certificate of Title**  
   - Applicable to Mortgages secured by a **Manufactured Home** in a **certificate of title state** with no cancellation process.  
   - If the law requires the owner to keep the original, the Servicer may retain a **copy** (see Section 5703.4(c)(iii)).

2. **Recorded Assignment to MERS®**  
   - When **not electronically recorded** under Sections 1401.14 or 1401.15, the Servicer must retain:  
     - The recorded **assignment of the Mortgage to MERS**, and  
     - Any **Intervening Assignments**, if the Servicer elected to retain these for MERS-registered Mortgages.

3. **NY CEMA Notes**  
   - For Mortgages using a **New York Consolidation, Extension and Modification Agreement (NY CEMA)**:  
     - Retain **Original Old Money Notes**, **Original New Money (Gap) Notes**, and any **Original Consolidated Notes** from prior consolidations (per Sections 4101.11, 3401.3, and 3301.3).

### Storage Standards
- Original paper documents and Mortgage files must be stored in a **fire-resistant area**.  
- Freddie Mac may require that each **Note** display the **Freddie Mac loan number**.  
- Maintain **backup paper or electronic copies** of all original paper documents in the Mortgage file.

---

## (b) Security Instruments

### Storage and Access
- The Security Instrument must be included as required in **Section 3301.2**.  
- When paper-based, store it with the same protections as original documents in subsection (a).  
- When stored **electronically**, the Servicer agrees to:
  - Obtain **certified copies** (paper or electronic) from the recorder’s office when needed for servicing or upon Freddie Mac’s request.
  - Notify any **Transferee Servicer** that the Mortgage’s Security Instrument is stored electronically and will be transferred or converted accordingly (per Section 7101.5(a)(1)).

### Representations and Warranties
The Servicer must certify that:
- Electronic storage **does not affect validity or enforceability** of the Security Instrument.  
- Electronic copies comply with **E-SIGN**, **UETA**, and other applicable laws.  
- Recorded Security Instruments:
  - Establish **valid first liens** on the property.  
  - Are securely stored as **Electronic Records** with full recordation data.

### Indemnification
- The Servicer indemnifies Freddie Mac for **any enforcement delay, loss, or expense** arising from failure to store paper originals.

### Security and Retention
- All Electronic copies with recording confirmations must be **secured and maintained** for the **life of the Mortgage + 7 years**.  
- Copies must also be retained in a **geographically remote backup location**.

## (c) Reproductions of Original Paper Documents
Servicers may store **paper or electronic reproductions** of other Mortgage file documents, provided that:

1. The reproductions are **legally admissible** in the applicable jurisdiction.  
2. The Servicer has a **written legal opinion** confirming their evidentiary admissibility.  
3. Copies are made under a **written policy** applied consistently to all Mortgage files.  
4. The reproduction method:
   - **Accurately and durably** reproduces the original, and  
   - Preserves all data for the **life of the Mortgage + 7 years**.  
5. The Servicer maintains **systems** capable of:
   - Viewing and printing legible paper copies, and  
   - Allowing Freddie Mac representatives access as needed.

### Prohibited Formats
- **Microfilm or microfiche** storage is prohibited for Mortgages with Note Dates after **June 30, 2013**.  
- Approved electronic formats include **PDF**, **TIF**, **JPEG**, and other standard business formats.

---

## (d) Electronic Mortgage File Documents
When Mortgage files contain both **converted paper** and **original electronic** documents:
- The Servicer may convert formats for business necessity (e.g., system migrations, mergers, transfers).  
- Conversion must **not alter or corrupt** the document’s visual image or data content.  
- The Servicer must ensure ongoing **integrity, readability, and retrievability** of all records.
