## Overview
This section defines Freddie Mac’s requirements for **Mortgage file control, organization, and identification**, ensuring that Servicers can promptly locate, update, and deliver files or reports for any Freddie Mac loan.  
It establishes key compliance standards for loan number management, MERS registration tracking, and retention of post-satisfaction documentation.

---

## Requirements

1. **Control and Identification Features**  
   The Servicer must maintain **control systems and identifiers** for every Mortgage file, regardless of whether the file is stored in paper or electronic form.  
   The system must:
   - Allow **ready identification of the Freddie Mac loan number** assigned to each Mortgage serviced for Freddie Mac.  
   - Allow **identification of MERS®-registered Mortgages**, including those closed with MERS as the **original mortgagee of record**.  
   - Allow **prompt retrieval** of the entire file or individual documents **by Freddie Mac loan number**.  
   - Allow **generation and delivery of reports**—both scheduled and unscheduled—organized by Freddie Mac loan number.  

---

2. **Loan Number Changes**  
   - If Freddie Mac assigns a **new loan number**, the Servicer must:
     - Promptly update all affected **Mortgage files and servicing records**, and  
     - Instruct the **Document Custodian** to make corresponding updates.

---

3. **Retention Period**  
   - The Servicer must retain each Mortgage file:
     - For as long as Freddie Mac maintains an **ownership or security interest** in the Mortgage, **and**
     - For at least **seven years** after Freddie Mac’s interest has been satisfied.

---

4. **Post-Satisfaction Documentation**
   - When the **Mortgage is paid in full**, the Mortgage file must contain:
     - A **copy of the canceled Note**.  
   - When a **Servicer repurchases a Mortgage** to effect a **Transfer of Ownership** that is **not authorized** or does not meet Freddie Mac requirements, the file must include:
     - A **copy of the executed Transfer of Ownership instrument**, or  
     - The **assumption/release of liability agreement** associated with the transaction.

---

### Retention Summary

| Scenario | Required Mortgage File Content | Retention Period |
|-----------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| Active Freddie Mac interest | Complete file with identifiers and records | Duration of Freddie Mac’s interest |
| Mortgage paid in full | Copy of canceled Note | ≥ 7 years post-satisfaction |
