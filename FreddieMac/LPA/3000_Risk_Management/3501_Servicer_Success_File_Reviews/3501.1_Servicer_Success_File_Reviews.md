## Overview

Section 3501.1 explains how Freddie Mac conducts **Servicer Success File Reviews** (“File Reviews”) under the **Servicing Success Program**.  
These reviews are performed on **delinquent Mortgages** and are separate from other Freddie Mac audits (e.g., Section 8101.4(c)).

This section details:

- Types of File Reviews  
- Servicer obligations when files are requested  
- Documentation requirements and deadlines  
- Review conclusions and appeal rights

# (a) Types of File Reviews

Freddie Mac will notify the Servicer in writing when specific Mortgages are selected for a File Review. Freddie Mac may conduct:

### **1. Prudent Servicing Review**
Assessment of:

- Collection efforts  
- Loss mitigation activities  
- Timeline and milestone management  
- Property preservation processes  

### **2. Short Sale Compliance Review**
Assessment of compliance with:

- Guide requirements  
- Purchase Documents  
- Short sale rules under Chapter 9204  

### **3. Loan Modification Compliance Review**
Assessment of compliance with:

- Modification rules under Chapters 9204 and 9205  
- All required modification terms and documentation  

Freddie Mac may expand or modify the types of File Reviews at any time.

---

# (b) File Review Requests

Freddie Mac sends a written notice identifying:

- **Loan numbers** selected  
- **Documentation required** for each file type  
- **Submission instructions**  
- **Deadline** — typically **30 calendar days** from the date of the request (unless otherwise specified)

### Servicer obligations

The Servicer must:

- Submit *all* requested documents in the format specified  
- Ensure submissions are complete and timely  
- Understand that *Freddie Mac may use any documents submitted*, even if not required  
- Provide additional files/documentation if Freddie Mac requests more during the review  

### Failure to Submit Documentation

If the Servicer fails to submit documentation:

- It is a **violation of the Purchase Documents**  
- Freddie Mac may pursue **all contractual rights and remedies**  
- The failure is treated as a **file defect**  
- It may impact the Servicer’s **overall performance rating** under Section 3501.2  

---

# (c) Review Conclusions and Appeal

After completing the File Review, Freddie Mac will issue:

- A **written conclusion**, including any identified defects  

### Servicer Appeal Rights

- Servicer has **15 Business Days** from the date of Freddie’s conclusions to respond or appeal  
- If the defect is due to a **missing or incorrect document**, the Servicer may submit the corrected document with the appeal  

### Appeals Not Allowed

If the Servicer **failed to submit ANY documents** in response to the initial File Review request and the result is:

**“Fail – Missing Docs”** → **NO appeal is permitted**

### Freddie Mac’s Final Decision

- Freddie Mac’s decision is **final and conclusive**  
- It may affect Servicer’s performance under Section 3501.2  
- Freddie Mac may rely on File Review conclusions or any other information when deciding remedies  

---

## Important Note
File Reviews **do not replace** the Servicer’s own default management quality control requirements.
