## Overview

Section 3501.2 establishes how Freddie Mac evaluates Servicer performance under the **Servicer Success Program**.  
The program uses confidential performance metrics published in the **Servicer Success Scorecard**.  
Metrics cover servicing quality, investor reporting, default management, staffing, audit results, and overall compliance.

Performance affects:

- Servicer rankings  
- Eligibility for certain Servicing benefits  
- SHARP℠ rewards  
- Potential disqualification or suspension

# (a) Servicer Performance

### 1. Servicer Success Scorecard  
Freddie Mac produces a confidential **monthly** Scorecard evaluating Servicers on key metrics, including:

- Investor reporting performance  
- Default management performance  
- Other operational quality indicators  

The Scorecard is incorporated by reference into:

- The Guide  
- Other Purchase Documents  

Freddie Mac may:

- Amend performance metrics  
- Modify scoring methodology  
- Revise Scorecard content  
- Revise SHARP program components  

All Scorecard content is deemed **confidential information** under Section 1201.8.

---

### 2. Individual Performance Goals  
Some Servicers may have customized performance goals defined in their Purchase Documents.

---

# (b) Servicer Performance Results

Freddie Mac will:

- Continuously monitor Servicer performance  
- Compare Servicers within similar portfolio “rank groups”  
- Publish monthly and annual rankings for certain groups  

### Rank Groups  
Servicers are grouped by:

- Portfolio composition  
- Portfolio size  
- Other Freddie-determined parameters  

### Bottom 25% Rule  
A Servicer is presumed to have an **unacceptable** Scorecard result if:

- Monthly **or** annual ranking in the default management category  
- Is in the **bottom 25%** of ranked Servicers in its group

This triggers risk assessment and possible consequences.

---

### Criteria Freddie Mac Considers for Suspension/Disqualification

Freddie Mac evaluates:

- Performance trends  
- Staffing adequacy  
- Audit results  
- Scorecard results  
- Servicer Success File Reviews  
- Compliance with all Purchase Documents  

These factors determine whether remedial actions or sanctions are necessary.

# (c) SHARP — Freddie Mac Rewards Program

**SHARP℠ (Servicer Honors and Rewards Program)** provides:

- Recognition  
- Incentives  
- Rewards  

for top-performing Servicers.
