### (a) Overview  

#### (i) Automated income assessment  
Representation and warranty relief eligibility depends on the Seller’s compliance with all requirements in this section.  
Asset and Income Modeler (AIM) automated income assessment using employed income data allows Sellers to use Freddie Mac–approved **Systems** (as defined in Section 2401.1(b)) to determine eligibility for relief from certain representations and warranties related to Borrower income.  

The Seller must obtain the Borrower’s employed income data and submit all required information to the applicable System. Based on submitted data, the System assesses for representation and warranty relief eligibility and returns the results.  

#### (ii) Automated income assessment of Closed Loans  
Sellers with access to Freddie Mac’s **API for automated income assessment with Loan Product Advisor®** using employed income data may submit **Closed Loan** data (a Mortgage in which the Seller/Servicer or Related Third Party has a beneficial ownership interest, per Section 2402.3(c)) for assessment.  

If eligible, the API response will return a PDF document titled **“AIM Payroll API R&W Assessment.”**  
Sellers must contact their Freddie Mac representative or Customer Service (800-FREDDIE) for approval before submitting Closed Loan data to the API.
