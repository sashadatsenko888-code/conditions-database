### (a) Temporary leave from current employment – general requirements and guidance  

Temporary leave from an employer may encompass various circumstances (e.g., family and medical, short-term disability, maternity, or other temporary leaves with or without pay).  
Temporary leave is generally short in duration. The length of time depends on applicable law, employer policies, and short-term insurance or benefit terms.  

Leave is **no longer considered temporary** when the Borrower:  
- Does not intend to return to the current employer, **or**  
- Does not have a commitment from the employer to return to employment.  

> The requirements and guidance in this section do **not** apply to employer-initiated actions such as furloughs or layoffs.  

If the Seller has knowledge that the Borrower has applied for, is receiving, or will receive long-term disability or insurance benefits, refer to **Chapter 5305** for long-term disability income requirements.  

---

### (b) Determining qualifying income and Borrower capacity to meet obligations while on temporary leave  

During a temporary leave, a Borrower’s income may be reduced or interrupted. The Seller must determine that the Borrower has sufficient capacity to repay the Mortgage and all monthly obligations during and after the leave, in accordance with **Topics 5100 through 5500**.  
This determination must be based on documentation, Seller knowledge, and available information.

---

#### (i) Borrowers returning **before or on** the first Mortgage payment due date  

- The Seller **may use the Borrower’s pre-leave gross monthly income** for qualification purposes.

---

#### (ii) Borrowers returning **after** the first Mortgage payment due date  

- The Seller **may use** the Borrower’s **gross monthly income being received during the temporary leave** to qualify.  
- If the Borrower’s income during leave has been reduced or interrupted, the Seller may combine:  
  - The monthly reduced income amount (which may be zero), and  
  - **Available liquid assets** used as a partial or full income supplement **up to the amount of the income reduction**.  

> The “Asset calculation for establishing the debt payment-to-income ratio” in **Section 5307.1(b)** does **not** apply when assets are used to supplement income during temporary leave.  

**Important:**  
- Assets required for Down Payment, Closing Costs, or Reserves **cannot** be used as available assets.  
- The total qualifying income **must not exceed** the Borrower’s pre-leave gross monthly income amount.  

---

### (c) Documentation requirements  

The following documentation is required for **all Borrowers on temporary leave**:

1. **Pre-leave income and employment verification** – in accordance with **Topic 5300**, regardless of leave status.  
2. **Written statement from the Borrower** (signed letter or direct email) confirming:  
   - Intent to return to the current employer, and  
   - Intended date of return.  
3. **Employer documentation confirming return eligibility**, such as:  
   - Employer-approved leave request;  
   - Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) documentation or equivalent employer record;  
   - Verification by a third-party administrator or verifier on behalf of the employer.  

---

Additional documentation required for **Borrowers returning after the first Mortgage payment due date**:

- Documentation evidencing **amount and duration** of temporary leave income being used to qualify (e.g., short-term disability benefits, sick pay, or reduced employer income).  
- Verification of **all liquid assets** used to supplement income during leave, meeting **Streamlined Accept Documentation** or **Standard Documentation** standards in **Section 5501.3**.  
- **Written rationale** from the Seller explaining the analysis used to determine qualifying income, regardless of underwriting path.
