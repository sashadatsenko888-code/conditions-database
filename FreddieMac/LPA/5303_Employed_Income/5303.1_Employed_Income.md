### (a) Requirements for all employed income  

All employed income used for qualifying must meet the requirements of this chapter and **Section 5301.1** for all stable monthly income.  

**(i) Stability and continuance of income**  
The Seller must determine that the amount of income used to qualify the Borrower is stable and expected to continue for at least three years. The Seller must analyze all income documentation while considering employment source, earnings type, income type, and employment history stability, including any gaps.  

A Borrower who has held different jobs may still have stable income if the amount has remained consistent. When evaluating frequent job changes, the Seller must determine whether the changes affect the Borrower’s ability to repay obligations.  

**(ii) Primary and secondary employment types**  
Primary employment is the Borrower’s main source of income (full-time, part-time, or seasonal).  
Secondary employment includes any additional job(s) beyond the primary employment.  

---

### (b) Employment history requirements  

**(i) Primary employment**  
- Typically, at least a **two-year** history of primary employment is required, documented on **Form 65** and verified per Topic 5300.  
- Active-duty U.S. Armed Forces members do not need a two-year history for their military employment to be considered stable.  
- Less than two years may be acceptable if justified with supporting documentation (e.g., returning to work after an absence, or new graduate entering workforce).  
- Minimum history for base fluctuating hourly earnings: see Section 5303.1(d).  

**(ii) Secondary employment**  
- Typically, a **two-year** history is required.  
- Less than two years (minimum 12 months) may be acceptable if documented and justified.  
- Examples include combining multiple part-time jobs or seasonal teaching.

### (c) Non-fluctuating employment earnings  

Requirements for history, continuance, calculation, and documentation are outlined below.  
Refer to Section 5303.1(e) for additional requirements that may apply based on employment characteristics.  

**(i) Base non-fluctuating earnings**  
Earnings are stable, consistent, and may be salaried or hourly with fixed pay.  
Minor variations in hours (< 1 hour per week) are acceptable.  

**Exception – minimum required hours:**  
If a position has a guaranteed minimum-hours schedule (confirmed by employer in writing and supported by YTD income), the minimum required hours may be treated as non-fluctuating.  

**Documentation and calculation:**  
Use YTD paystub(s), W-2 form(s), and 10-day PCV (or written VOE + 10-day PCV).  
Apply the appropriate frequency conversion (weekly × 52 ÷ 12, bi-weekly × 26 ÷ 12, semi-monthly × 24 ÷ 12, etc.).  

---

**(ii) Military earnings**  
- **Base (basic) pay:** considered non-fluctuating; no history requirement for active-duty members.  
- **Entitlements:** rations, hazard, flight, clothing, quarters – no history required; must continue for 3 years.  
- **Reserve/National Guard:** one-year history; must continue 3 years.  
Documentation: Military Leave and Earnings Statement or written VOE + 10-day PCV.  

---

**(iii) Additional fixed employment earnings**  
Includes fixed allowances such as automobile allowance or mortgage differential.  

| Earnings type | History | Continuance | Documentation | Calculation |
|----------------|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Automobile allowance** | 2 years consecutive | Likely to continue 3 years | YTD paystub(s), W-2s (2 years), 10-day PCV or written VOE + PCV | Add full allowance to qualifying income (do not offset auto expense) |
| **Mortgage differential** | None required | Must continue ≥ 3 years | Employer agreement stating terms and duration; must be an established program and employer not an interested party | Add payment amount to qualifying income; cannot offset housing expense |

---

### (d) Fluctuating employment earnings  

Covers base fluctuating hourly earnings and additional fluctuating earnings (bonus, commission, overtime, tips, unemployment).  
Refer to Section 5303.1(e) for additional documentation guidance.  

**(i) Base fluctuating hourly earnings**  
- Require at least 12 months of employment (history may include prior similar roles).  
- Must continue ≥ 3 years.  
- Documentation: YTD paystub(s), W-2(s), 10-day PCV (or VOE + PCV).  

**Calculation and trend analysis:**  
- Average YTD and prior year(s) earnings.  
- Analyze trend (consistency, increase, decline).  
- Degree of fluctuation ≤ 10% = consistent; > 10% ≤ 30% = additional analysis; > 30% = documented support required.  
- Pay raises may justify using higher averages if verified by documentation.  
- Exclude one-time events (unlikely to recur) from average with justification.  

**Declining trends:** Use current YTD income only unless temporary one-time event documented.  

---

**(ii) Additional fluctuating earnings**  
Includes bonus, commission, overtime, tips, unemployment compensation tied to seasonal work, and RS/RSU income.  
General rules: ≥ 12 months history (min 1 year, usually 2 years), likely to continue 3 years, analyze trend and average appropriately.  

- **Bonus/commission/overtime/tips (employer-reported):** YTD paystub(s), W-2s (2 years), 10-day PCV (or VOE + PCV).  
- **Cash/charge tips (IRS Form 4137):** IRS Form 4137 (2 years), complete tax returns (2 years), 10-day PCV.  
- **Unemployment (seasonal):** Proof of receipt 2 years (e.g., 1099-G), likely to continue 3 years.  
- **Restricted Stock / RSUs:**  
  - *Performance-based:* ≥ 12 months (current employer, vested/distributed shares). Use average of last 24 months (pre-tax value × 200-day SMA ÷ 24).  
  - *Time-based:* ≥ 1 year history; use 12-month average.  
  - Must include vesting schedule, evidence stock is publicly traded, and documentation of payouts.
