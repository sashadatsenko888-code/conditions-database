## Overview  

This section sets requirements for establishing and evaluating the **monthly housing expense-to-income ratio** (housing ratio).  
The ratio equals the Borrower’s **monthly housing expense ÷ stable monthly income and/or qualifying asset amount** (per Section 5307.1(b)).  

Contents:  
- Establishing monthly housing expense for Primary Residences  
- Establishing monthly housing expense for second homes and Investment Properties  
- Establishing monthly housing expense for Mortgages with a non-occupying Borrower  
- Rental payment documentation requirements  
- Housing expense-to-income ratio requirements by underwriting method  
- Other Guide references  

The monthly housing expense must be documented in the Mortgage file and established as described below.  

---

## (a) Primary Residences  

Include **all** of the following items in the housing expense calculation:

- Principal and interest payments on the Mortgage  
- Property hazard insurance premiums  
- Real estate taxes  
  - **New construction:** if tax bill unavailable → base on value of improvements + land  
  - **Transfer of ownership:** include estimate of recalculated taxes if jurisdiction requires re-assessment  
  - **Tax abatement/exemption:** may reduce or exclude real estate tax amount if documentation shows continuance ≥ 5 years after Note Date  

> **Exception:** if exemption due to Borrower’s age or disability → no five-year continuance proof required (provided no expiration within five years).  

Also include, when applicable:

- Mortgage insurance premiums  
- Flood insurance premiums  
- Leasehold payments  
- Special assessments (with > 10 monthly payments remaining)  
- Homeowners association (HOA) dues (excluding unit utilities)  
- Maintenance fees (excluding unit utilities)  
- Payments on secondary financing (incl. HELOCs)  

> **HELOCs:**  
> - Include a monthly payment when balance exists.  
> - If no payment shown and none documented → use **1.5 % of outstanding balance** as monthly payment.  
> - See Section 4204.1 (HELOC terms documentation) and Section 5501.3 (when HELOC proceeds used in transaction).  

Include recurring monthly payments for **resale-restricted properties** tied to financial subsidies (see Section 4406.3).

## (b) Second Homes and Investment Properties  

The monthly housing expense equals the **sum of all charges listed in (a)** for each Borrower’s Primary Residence.  

If a Borrower **rents** their principal domicile, include the Borrower’s **rental payment** for that domicile in the housing expense ratio.  

---

## (c) Mortgages with a Non-Occupying Borrower  

Use the same approach as (b):  
- Sum all expenses from (a) for each Borrower’s Primary Residence.  
- If a Borrower rents their home, include that monthly rental payment in the housing expense ratio.  

---

## (d) Rental Payment Documentation Requirements  

When the Borrower rents their principal domicile, verify monthly rent using **one** of the following:  

1. Direct verification of rent from a management company, **or**  
2. Direct verification from an individual landlord + two months of canceled checks (or other proof of two payments), **or**  
3. Copy of current, fully executed lease + two months of canceled checks (or other proof of two payments), **or**  
4. Six months of canceled checks or bank statements showing consistent payments in qualifying amount.

## (e) Housing Expense-to-Income Ratio Requirements by Underwriting Method  

### (i) Mortgages Underwritten with Loan Product Advisor®  
Loan Product Advisor (LPA) calculates and assesses qualifying ratios from submitted data.  
For **Accept** Mortgages, LPA has determined ratios are acceptable.  

### (ii) Manually Underwritten Mortgages  

#### (A) All Manually Underwritten Mortgages  
- Seller must evaluate Borrower’s capacity to pay housing expense and other debts.  
- **Guideline:** housing expense-to-income ratio ≤ **28 %**.  
- Exceptions require documented offsets in Mortgage file.  
  - Examples of offsets → Section 5401.2(d).  
- Generally allow more flexibility for housing ratio than for total DTI.  
- Less flexibility if additional risk layers exist (ARMs, marginal credit, low reserves, max financing).  
- When ratios exceed guidelines, Seller must retain a **written justification** in file.  

#### (B) Additional Requirements for GreenCHOICE Mortgages®  
Higher ratios may be appropriate due to lower utility costs from energy efficiency.  

If using higher ratios, Seller must provide one of the following to the appraiser and retain a copy in file:  
- **HERS Report** by certifie
