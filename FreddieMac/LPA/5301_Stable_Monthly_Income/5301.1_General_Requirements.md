Section: 5301.1 - General Requirements for Stable Monthly Income  
Effective Date: 04/01/2025  

This section outlines requirements and guidance for determining a Borrower’s stable monthly income used to qualify for a Mortgage.  

---

Condition #1:  
Overview of stable monthly income  

Topic 5300 provides requirements and guidance for determining **stable monthly income**. The Seller must determine when additional analysis or documentation is needed to support that the Borrower’s income is **stable and consistent**.  

---

Condition #2:  
General requirements for all stable monthly income  

**Stable monthly income** is defined as the Borrower’s **verified gross monthly income** from acceptable, verifiable sources that can **reasonably be expected to continue for at least the next three years**.  

For each income source, the Seller must confirm both the **source** and **amount** are stable and show a consistent level of earnings.  

All income used for qualification — whether or not specifically identified in Topic 5300 — must meet stable monthly income requirements. Improperly calculated or unsupported income may **invalidate** the Loan Product Advisor® (LPA) Risk Class on the Feedback Certificate.  

**Cryptocurrency:**  
Income paid in cryptocurrency **cannot** be used for qualification.  

**Written analysis requirement:**  
The Seller must include in the Mortgage file a **written analysis** explaining:  
- The calculation used to determine qualifying income (unless self-evident from documents, e.g., fixed Social Security or annual salary).  
- The rationale supporting the source’s and amount’s stability, history, calculation, and continuance.  

**Mortgage file documentation:**  
All income documentation must be **retained in the Mortgage file**.  

---

Condition #3:  
Income stability and history requirements  

The Seller must evaluate both the **length of income history** and **consistency of earnings**.  
A **two-year history** of consistent income is typically required to consider income stable for qualification.  

The Seller must determine if additional documentation — such as an additional year of earnings — is needed when income fluctuates or when additional layering of risk exists.  

Borrowers may have varied income sources, but overall **consistency of income level** is required despite changes in employment or source type.  

---

Condition #4:  
Income continuance requirements  

The Seller must determine that income used for qualification is **reasonably expected to continue** for at least **three years**. This assessment must be based on:  
- Past employment/self-employment history,  
- History of income receipt, and  
- The likelihood of continued consistent income receipt.  

The Seller must **not** include income for qualification if there is knowledge or documentation that contradicts a reasonable expectation of continuance.

| (A) | Income and earnings typically without documentable continuance (likely to continue) | Table A |
| (B) | Income with documentable continuance | Table B |
| (C) | Income that may or may not have documentable continuance depending on source | Table C |
