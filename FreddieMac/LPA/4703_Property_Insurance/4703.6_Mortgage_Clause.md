### MERS-Registered Mortgages

If the Mortgage is registered with **MERSÂ®** and originated naming MERS as the mortgagee of record:

- **MERS may never be named as loss payee** on any property insurance policy.  
- The Seller/Servicer must ensure **all insurance drafts, policies, invoices, and notices** are sent directly to the Seller/Servicer, **not** to MERS.  
- Even though the MERS address appears in county land records, it must **not be used** for correspondence related to insurance documentation.

---

### When Mortgage Clause Is Not Applicable

If a policy type does not require a mortgage clause (e.g., **Commercial General Liability** policy):

- A **certificate of insurance** must be issued to the Seller/Servicer instead.  
- The certificate must comply with Section **8202.4** requirements,  
  naming the **Seller/Servicer as certificate holder**, not as mortgagee.
