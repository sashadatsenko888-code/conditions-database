## (a) Determining if a property requires flood insurance

A flood zone determination (FZD) must be made for each property securing a Mortgage sold to Freddie Mac.

The FZD must be documented on FEMA Form 086-0-032, Standard Flood Hazard Determination Form (SFHDF).  
- The form may be printed or electronic.  
- It must be retained for the life of the Mortgage.  
- All mandatory SFHDF fields must be present even in electronic format.

The “Date of Determination” on the SFHDF:
- must be no more than 120 days before the Note Date (or Note Date of the refinance Mortgage),  
- OR may be older than 120 days only if the Seller uses a “life of loan” flood determination service that issues a life-of-loan certificate.

The “Loan Identifier” field on the SFHDF must match the loan number (or other identifying information) for that specific Mortgage.

The Seller/Servicer warrants that any third-party FZD is accurate and compliant, but Freddie Mac still holds the Seller/Servicer responsible for accuracy.

If the SFHDF shows that the insurable improvements on the Mortgaged Premises are in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) with a FEMA zone containing the letter “A” or “V,” the Seller/Servicer must ensure flood insurance is obtained and maintained for the full mortgage term.

The Seller/Servicer may waive or discontinue the flood insurance requirement only if one of the following is obtained:
- Letter of Determination Review (LODR) from FEMA stating the insurable improvements are not in the SFHA,  
- Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA excluding the insurable improvements or entire property from the SFHA,  
- Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA removing the community’s SFHA designation.

Borrower must maintain flood insurance until a LOMA, LOMR, or LODR is issued.  
A copy of the LOMA/LOMR/LODR must be in the Mortgage file.

If the insurable improvements are in an SFHA but the community does not participate in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the Mortgage is **not eligible** for sale to Freddie Mac.

If FEMA has not mapped the area:
- and the Seller/Servicer is **not aware of flood risk**, the Mortgage is eligible for sale without flood insurance.  
- but the Seller/Servicer **is aware of flood risk**, the Mortgage is **not eligible** for sale without flood insurance.

---

## (b) Acceptable flood insurance policies

Flood insurance may be:
- a standard NFIP policy, **or**
- a private flood policy that meets Section 4703.1 requirements and is at least equivalent to NFIP in coverage, deductibles, exclusions, and conditions for the insured improvement type.

---

## (c) Coverage required

### (i) 1- to 4-unit properties

If the community participates in the **Emergency Program of the NFIP**, required coverage on insurable improvements is the lowest of:
- the unpaid principal balance (UPB) of the Mortgage,  
- the maximum amount of coverage sold under the NFIP Emergency Program for that property type,  
- the replacement cost of the insurable improvements.

When the community transitions into the **Regular Program of the NFIP**, flood insurance must be increased to meet Regular Program requirements.

If the community participates in the **Regular Program of the NFIP**, required coverage on insurable improvements is the lowest of:
- the UPB of the Mortgage,  
- the maximum amount of coverage sold under the NFIP Regular Program for that property type,  
- the replacement cost of the insurable improvements.

The deductible may not exceed the current NFIP maximum deductible for that improvement type.

For 1- to 4-unit properties, the Seller/Servicer may waive flood insurance for detached structures on the Mortgaged Premises if:
- the detached structure is not a residence, and  
- it is separate from the primary residential structure.

---

### (ii) PUD or ground lease community units

Apply the same flood insurance requirements used for 1- to 4-unit properties to similar residential properties within a PUD or ground lease community.

---

### (iii) Condominium Units

For a Condominium Unit in:
- a 2- to 4-Unit Condominium Project, or  
- a Detached Condominium Project,  

→ Apply the same flood insurance requirements as for 1- to 4-unit properties.

For a Condominium Unit in any other Condominium Project where any part of the building is in an SFHA:

**Condominium homeowners association coverage requirements:**
- Building coverage must be the lower of:  
  - 80% of the building’s replacement cost, or  
  - the maximum NFIP building coverage per unit.
- Contents coverage must be the lower of:  
  - 100% of the insurable replacement cost of common contents, or  
  - the maximum NFIP contents coverage for a condo building.
- Association deductibles (building and contents) may not exceed the max deductibles currently allowed by NFIP.

**Unit owner supplemental coverage:**
- If the association’s allocation to the individual unit is not enough to satisfy the 1- to 4-unit requirement,  
  → the Borrower must maintain supplemental coverage on that unit to close the gap.
- The deductible on the Borrower’s supplemental coverage may not exceed the max deductible allowed for a 1- to 4-unit property.

---

### (iv) Cooperative Corporations

If any building in the Cooperative Project is located in an SFHA:
- The Cooperative Corporation must maintain flood insurance on that building.

Required building coverage:
- the lower of  
  - 100% of the building’s replacement cost, or  
  - the maximum NFIP building coverage available.

Required contents coverage:
- the lower of  
  - 100% of replacement cost of the Coop-owned contents, or  
  - the maximum NFIP contents coverage.

Deductibles for both building and contents coverage may not exceed the maximums currently allowed under NFIP.

A blanket flood policy is acceptable if it covers more than one building, **as long as** each individual building is insured to at least the required building and contents limits above.
