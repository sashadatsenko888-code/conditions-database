Section: 4703.7 – Localized Perils Insurance  
Effective Date: 06/10/2020  

---

## Overview
This section establishes requirements for **localized perils insurance**, which applies when specific natural or geological hazards exist that are **not covered under standard property insurance**.

---

## Requirement
If the **Seller/Servicer** becomes aware of localized perils — such as:
- sinkhole,
- mine subsidence,
- volcanic eruption, or
- landslides —

and these hazards are **not covered** by the borrower’s standard property insurance policy,  
then the **Seller/Servicer must require the Borrower to obtain appropriate additional insurance coverage**.

Such coverage must comply with:
- the terms of the **Security Instrument**, and  
- **applicable state or local law** governing insurance requirements.

---

### Practical Notes
- This obligation applies even if the property is otherwise eligible for sale to Freddie Mac.  
- The Seller/Servicer must confirm that any such additional coverage is **current, valid, and adequate** to mitigate the identified localized peril risk.
