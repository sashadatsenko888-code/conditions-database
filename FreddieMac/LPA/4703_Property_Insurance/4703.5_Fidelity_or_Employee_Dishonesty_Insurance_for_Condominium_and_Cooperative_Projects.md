## Overview
Effective June 10, 2020, the content of this section was moved from Section 8202.3(b).  
This section outlines **fidelity (employee dishonesty) insurance** requirements for Condominium and Cooperative Projects securing Mortgages sold to Freddie Mac.

---

## Applicability
Fidelity or employee dishonesty insurance is **required** for all Condominium and Cooperative Projects, **except** the following:

- Condominium Projects reviewed under the **streamlined project review type** (Section 5701.4)  
- Condominium Projects or Unit Mortgages meeting Section **5701.7** and delivered as **Exempt From Review**  
- Cooperative Share Loans meeting Section **5705.7** and delivered as **Exempt From Review**  
- **Freddie Mac Enhanced Relief Refinance® Mortgages**  
- Projects consisting of **20 units or fewer**  
- Projects where the calculated required coverage amount is **≤ $5,000**

If State law imposes different requirements for fidelity or employee dishonesty insurance, **compliance with State law satisfies Freddie Mac’s standard.**

---

## Insurance Requirement

The **condominium homeowners association (HOA)** or **Cooperative Corporation** must maintain fidelity or employee dishonesty insurance covering **losses due to dishonest or fraudulent acts** committed by:

- directors,  
- managers,  
- trustees,  
- employees, or  
- volunteers  

who handle or control the association’s or corporation’s funds.

If a **professional management firm** manages the funds, that firm must:
- maintain its own fidelity/employee dishonesty coverage, **or**
- be covered under the HOA’s or Cooperative Corporation’s policy.  
  The management firm must provide **proof of such coverage**.

---

## Policy Characteristics

The fidelity or employee dishonesty insurance policy must meet all the following standards:

1. **Named Insured:**  
   - The policy must name the condominium HOA or Cooperative Corporation as the insured.  
   - Premiums must be paid as a **common expense**.

2. **Coverage Limit:**  
   - Must equal at least the **maximum amount of funds** held by the HOA, Cooperative Corporation, or management firm **at any one time**.  
   - A lower limit is acceptable **only** if the Project Documents require specific **financial controls** (listed below).  
   - If reduced coverage applies, it must be **no less than three months of total assessments or maintenance fees** on all units.

3. **Acceptable Reduced Coverage Based on Financial Controls:**  
   Freddie Mac permits lower coverage amounts when the following safeguards are in place (at least **one** must apply):

   - **Separate accounts** are maintained for operating and reserve funds, and the **depository institution sends monthly statements directly** to the HOA or Cooperative Corporation.  
   - **Separate records and accounts** exist for each HOA or Cooperative using the management firm’s services, and the management firm **cannot draw or transfer reserve funds**.  
   - **Two or more board members** are required to sign any checks drawn on the reserve fund.
