Section: 4703.4 – Liability Insurance for Condominium Projects and Cooperative Projects  
Effective Date: 07/09/2025  

---

## Overview
Effective June 10, 2020, the content of this section was moved from Section 8202.3(a).  
This section establishes **liability insurance requirements** for all **Condominium Projects** and **Cooperative Projects** securing Mortgages sold to Freddie Mac.

Liability insurance protects the association or corporation, as well as unit owners, against legal and financial exposure for injury or property damage occurring in shared areas.

---

## Applicability

Liability insurance is **required** for all:
- Condominium Projects, and  
- Cooperative Projects  

**Except** the following cases:
- Condominium Projects reviewed under the **streamlined project review type** in Section 5701.4,  
- Condominium Projects or Condominium Unit Mortgages meeting Section 5701.7 and delivered as **Exempt From Review**,  
- Cooperative Share Loans meeting Section 5701.7 and delivered as **Exempt From Review**,  
- **Freddie Mac Enhanced Relief Refinance® Mortgages.**

---

## Insurance Requirements

The **Condominium homeowners association (HOA)** or **Cooperative Corporation** must maintain **commercial general liability (CGL)** insurance covering:
- all **common areas**,  
- **Common Elements**,  
- **commercial spaces**, and  
- **public ways** within the project.

If the standard CGL policy terms do not include it, a **“severability of interest” endorsement** must be added.  
This endorsement prevents the insurer from denying a unit owner’s claim due to negligent acts or omissions by the association, corporation, or another unit owner.

---

## Coverage Limits

- Minimum insurer’s **limit of liability per occurrence** (for personal injury, bodily injury, or property damage): **at least $1,000,000**.  
- The coverage must provide for **claim settlements on an occurrence basis** (not claims-made).
