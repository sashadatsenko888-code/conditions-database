Section: 4703.2 – Minimum Property Insurance Types and Amounts  
Effective Date: 06/01/2024

## Overview
This section outlines **Freddie Mac’s minimum property insurance requirements** for 1- to 4-unit properties, PUDs, condominiums, and cooperative units.  
The purpose is to ensure that the **Mortgaged Premises remain adequately insured** against major perils and that policy limits are sufficient to cover replacement cost value (RCV) or unpaid principal balance (UPB), whichever is greater.

---

## (a) 1- to 4-Unit Properties
The insurable improvements must be covered for loss or damage caused by:  
Fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, explosion, riot, civil commotion, aircraft, vehicles, and smoke.  

- If any peril is excluded from the primary policy, supplemental coverage must be provided through a secondary policy.  
- The deductible for fire, water (not caused by flooding), or wind damage **cannot exceed 5%** of the dwelling coverage limit.  
- Policies must provide for claims settlement on a **replacement cost basis** (not actual cash value).  

### Required Insurance Coverage
Coverage must equal the greater of:  
- The unpaid principal balance (UPB) of the mortgage, or  
- 80% of the full replacement cost value (RCV) of the insurable improvements.  

If 80% of RCV exceeds the UPB, the 80% calculation becomes the required amount.  
The required RCV must be verified using an insurance carrier’s replacement cost estimator or equivalent documentation.

## (b) Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) and Ground Lease Communities
- Individual unit owners may insure their units separately if they meet the requirements in (a).  
- A **master insurance policy** may cover all units if required by governing documents.  
  - The master policy must provide **100% replacement cost coverage** and settle claims on a replacement cost basis.  
- Required endorsements (if available in the market):  
  - Inflation guard endorsement  
  - Building ordinance or law endorsement  
  - Equipment breakdown endorsement (if applicable)  
- Deductible may not exceed 5% of building coverage; higher per-unit deductibles require borrower HO-6 coverage.  
- The policy must name insureds as:  
  - *Association of Owners of [PUD Name] for the use and benefit of the individual owners.*

---

## (c) Condominium Projects
- Coverage options depend on project documents:  
  - The homeowners association (HOA) insures the buildings and common elements.  
  - If interiors are not covered, each borrower must maintain an **HO-6 policy** sufficient to restore the unit.  
- Master policy requirements:  
  - 100% replacement cost coverage for buildings and common areas  
  - Replacement cost basis (no cash value limitations)  
  - Required endorsements: inflation guard, building ordinance/law, and equipment breakdown  
- Deductible for fire, water, or wind may not exceed 5% of building coverage.  
- If exceeded due to per-unit deductible, borrower’s HO-6 must cover the excess.  
- Sample insured clause:  
  - *Association of Owners of [Condominium Project Name] Condominium for the use and benefit of the individual owners.*

---

## (d) Cooperative Corporations
- The Cooperative Corporation must insure all structures, fixtures, and common equipment serving the project.  
- If interiors are not covered, borrowers must carry an **HO-6 unit owner’s policy**.  
- Master policy must:  
  - Cover at least **100% of replacement cost value (RCV)**  
  - Provide replacement cost settlement  
  - Include inflation guard, building ordinance/law, and equipment breakdown endorsements where available  
- Deductible limit: not to exceed **5% of building coverage**.  
- Borrower HO-6 coverage required if deductible exceeds 5% or if per-unit deductibles apply.  
- Sample insured clause:  
  - *[Name of Cooperative Corporation] for the use and benefit of the individual shareholders.*
