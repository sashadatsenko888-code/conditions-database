Section: 5601.1 – Property Eligibility Requirements  
Effective Date: 04/02/2025  

This section contains requirements related to:
- Eligible properties  
- Ineligible properties  

Freddie Mac expects the Seller to place as much emphasis on the adequacy of the property as collateral as it does on underwriting the Borrower’s creditworthiness.  
The determination that a Mortgage is eligible for sale must be based on confirming that:  
- The Borrower is creditworthy (acceptable credit reputation and capacity), and  
- The Mortgaged Premises is adequate and acceptable collateral for the transaction.  

The Seller is responsible for confirming both property eligibility and appraisal acceptability.
