## Overview
**CHOICEHome®** refers to a type of **HUD-coded Manufactured Home** designed with enhanced aesthetics, construction quality, and dwelling specifications comparable to **site-built properties**.  
These homes exceed minimum HUD standards and qualify under specific Freddie Mac eligibility and underwriting requirements.

---

## (a) Purchase of Mortgages Secured by CHOICEHomes
The Seller must verify that the subject property meets **CHOICEHome eligibility requirements**, supported by an appraisal and, when required, a final inspection confirming:

- The presence of the **Freddie Mac CHOICEHome notice** or **Fannie Mae MH Advantage® sticker**, located near the HUD Data Plate  
- For **new CHOICEHomes** – both the **HUD Data Plate** and **HUD Certification Label(s)** must be present and legible  
- For **existing CHOICEHomes** – the **HUD Data Plate** or **HUD Certification Label(s)** must be present; if missing, follow documentation standards in **§ 5703.2**

> Note: The CHOICEHome notice confirms compliance with CHOICEHome manufacturing specs as of the date of manufacture — it does *not* guarantee current Freddie Mac eligibility.
