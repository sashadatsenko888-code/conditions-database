| Third Comparable | May be a site-built or other factory-built home, if adequately explained. |
| Additional Comparables | Appraiser may include more than three comparable sales or listings if necessary for credible value support. |
| Controlled Market Rule | If in a subdivision or project controlled by a builder/developer, at least one comparable sale must be **outside** developer/builder influence (resales within the project are acceptable if not influenced). |
| Land + Home Combinations | Appraiser may **not** use combined vacant land sales plus home purchase prices as comparables. |

> If at least two similar Manufactured Home sales are unavailable → the Mortgage is **ineligible** for sale to Freddie Mac.
