## Overview
This section details Freddie Mac’s **real property classification, title, lien perfection, and documentation** requirements for Mortgages secured by Manufactured Homes.  
The Seller must ensure that the **Manufactured Home and the land** constitute real property and that Freddie Mac’s lien is properly created, evidenced, and perfected under all applicable State laws.

---

## (a) Real Property Requirements
A Mortgage is eligible for sale to Freddie Mac only if it is secured by a **perfected First Lien** on **real estate** consisting of both:
- The **Manufactured Home**, and  
- The **land** on which the home is **permanently affixed**.

The Seller must ensure that the Mortgaged Premises qualifies as **real property** under applicable **State statutes, regulations, and case law**.

### State-Specific Requirements

| State Procedure | Requirement Summary |
|:--|:--|
| **States with surrender and cancelation procedures** | Seller must follow all **statutory or administrative procedures** to surrender and cancel the certificate of title. <br>_Example:_ Filing an **affidavit of affixture** or similar evidence of intent to convert the home to real property. |
| **States without surrender and cancelation procedures** | Seller must follow **title-lien perfection** requirements on the certificate of title. <br>_Example:_ Record a foundation form in land records and file with the State manufactured-housing agency. |
| **States with no formal surrender process** | Mortgage is eligible only if the State has **no legal or administrative mechanism** for surrendering or canceling a certificate of title. In such States, the lien may remain evidenced by the title record. |

> **Note:** Property-tax classification as real estate alone does **not** prove legal conversion to real property.

1. The Manufactured Home is **legally classified as real property**.  
2. The home is **properly titled**.

- **Identifies** the Manufactured Home located on the property, and  
- **Insures** against loss if the Manufactured Home is determined **not to be real property**.

- The **State-specific equivalent endorsement** (e.g., **T-31** in Texas).
