## (b) Borrower Contributions

### (i) Land as an Equity Contribution
If the Borrower owns the land on which the Manufactured Home will be permanently affixed, the land’s value may be used as equity.

| Borrower Land Ownership at Application | Equity Contribution Determination |
|:--|:--|
| **Owned ≥ 12 months** | Current **appraised value** of the land. |
| **Owned < 12 months** | Lower of (1) current appraised value or (2) land purchase price. |

**Required Documentation**
- Certified copy of the **Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement**  
- Copy of the **warranty deed** showing no existing liens, **or** a copy of the lien release(s)

If the Borrower **acquired the land as a gift, inheritance, or non-purchase transfer** within 12 months prior to the Application Received Date, the Seller must obtain documents verifying the transfer of ownership. In such cases, the land’s equity value equals its **current appraised value**.

---

### (ii) Trade as an Equity Contribution
When the Borrower trades an **Existing Manufactured Home** as part of the transaction, the equity contribution is limited as follows:

| Ownership Duration | Maximum Equity Contribution |
|:--|:--|
| **Owned ≥ 12 months** | 90% of the retail value (per **N.A.D.A. Manufactured Housing Appraisal Guide®**) |
| **Owned < 12 months** | Lesser of:<br> • 90% of retail value (N.A.D.A.) or<br> • Lowest sale price within the preceding 12 months |

**Adjustments**
- Subtract any **removal costs** of the traded home.  
- Subtract any **outstanding indebtedness** secured by liens on the traded home.

**Required Documentation**
- **Lien search** in real or personal property records confirming ownership and any existing liens.  
- **Proof of title transfer** and **lien satisfaction** from the seller of the new Manufactured Home.

## (c) Layering of Risk
Because a **Manufactured Home** represents a higher-risk collateral type, the Seller must evaluate the overall Mortgage risk holistically using the **Three Cs** framework:

| Component | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Credit Reputation** | Borrower’s credit history and score. |
| **Capacity** | Borrower’s ability to repay (income vs. debt). |
| **Collateral** | Property value, condition, and marketability. |

### Risk-Management Principles
- A Manufactured Home introduces **additional collateral risk**.  
- Avoid combining this risk with **weaknesses in capacity or credit reputation**.  
- Document in the Mortgage file how the overall risk remains acceptable per **§ 5102.2**.

**Examples**
1. **Acceptable Scenario:** Borrower has strong credit and income capacity — may offset the higher collateral risk; maximum financing acceptable.  
2. **Unacceptable Scenario:** Borrower has short or weak credit history and the collateral is a Manufactured Home — excessive layering of risk; Mortgage ineligible.
