### (a) Lender credit: definition and requirements
A **lender credit** is a contribution by the originating lender toward the Borrower’s Closing Costs.  

Lender credit must meet all of the following requirements:
- The amount of lender credit must:
  - Be derived from an increase in the interest rate (**premium pricing**), or  
  - Be funded directly by the lender  
- Lender credit **must not require repayment**  
- **Third-party funds** must not be used to provide a lender credit  
- Lender credit may only be used as a **credit toward Borrower’s Closing Costs**

If the lender credit **exceeds the Borrower’s Closing Costs**, one of the following must apply:
- The lender credit must be **reduced** so it does not exceed the Borrower’s Closing Costs, or  
- The excess amount must be **applied as a principal curtailment** and clearly reflected on the **Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement**  
  - (See Section 6302.32 for delivery requirements for Mortgages with principal curtailments.)

**Restriction:**  
Lender credit derived from premium pricing must **not** be used to fund a **temporary subsidy buydown plan** on a “no cash-out” refinance Mortgage.  

---

### (b) Lender incentive: definition and requirements
A **lender incentive** is:
- A **cash or cash-like contribution** (e.g., gift card) or other item of value,  
- Provided by the originating lender to the Borrower (directly or through a third party),  
- And **not** a lender credit toward the Borrower’s Closing Costs.  

Mortgages with lender incentives are **eligible for sale to Freddie Mac** if the following requirements are met — regardless of whether the incentive is provided **before, on, or after** the Note Date:

1. **No repayment** of the incentive may be required  
2. The cost or value of the incentive must **not be funded through the Mortgage transaction** (e.g., premium pricing)  
3. The incentive must **not be considered when qualifying** the Borrower (not counted as a source of funds for closing or reserves)  
4. If the originating lender **is or is affiliated with an interested party**, the lender incentive must be treated as a **sales concession** per Section 5501.6(c)  

**Note:**  
A lender incentive is **not considered cash out** to the Borrower and does **not** have to be included in the Mortgage proceeds or cash-back calculation.
