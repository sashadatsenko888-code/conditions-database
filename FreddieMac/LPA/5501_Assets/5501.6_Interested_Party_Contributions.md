- In connection with the Mortgage or the real estate transaction,

#### (iv) Documentation of interested party contributions
The **amount and source** of all interested party contributions must:
- Be documented in the Mortgage file, and  
- Be clearly shown on the **Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement**.  

---

### (b) Financing concessions: definition, acceptable uses, and maximum limits

#### (i) Definition and acceptable uses
Financing concessions are interested party contributions that may only be used to pay:
- The Borrower’s **Closing Costs**, and/or  
- Up to **12 months of HOA dues**, if:  
  - The Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement shows the funds were collected at closing, and  
  - The funds were disbursed directly to the HOA.  

Contributions exceeding actual Closing Costs or 12 months of HOA dues must meet **sales concession** requirements under Section 5501.6(c), except that paying more than 12 months of HOA dues is an **abatement** (see Section 5501.6(d)).

---

#### (ii) Maximum financing concession limits
The maximum permitted financing concessions, calculated as a percentage of value (per Section 4203.1(a)):

| Occupancy | LTV/TLTV > 90% | LTV/TLTV > 75% ≤ 90% | LTV/TLTV ≤ 75% |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Primary Residences & Second Homes | 3% | 6% | 9% |
| Investment Properties | 2% | 2% | 2% |

**Exceptions:**  
- Concessions contributed by **Freddie Mac** as the seller for REO properties  
- Borrower fees or costs customarily paid by the seller per local convention  

Any concession amount exceeding these limits must meet **sales concession** requirements in Section 5501.6(c).

### (c) Sales concessions: definition and impact on LTV calculation

#### (i) Sales concessions definition
Sales concessions are interested party contributions that:
- Exceed the maximum financing concession percentages in Section 5501.6(b)(ii), **and/or**

Examples include:

- Rebates (e.g., agent rebates) not qualifying as financing concessions  
- Reimbursements to the Borrower for short sale processing or negotiation fees  

---

#### (ii) Impact of sales concessions on LTV calculation
- **Loan Product Advisor® Mortgages:**  
  Loan Product Advisor determines LTV based on the purchase price or appraised value and the value of sales concessions entered into the system.  

- **Manually Underwritten Mortgages:**  
  - Deduct the dollar amount/value of sales concessions from the purchase price when determining value (Section 4203.1(a)).  
  - Use the **lower** of the reduced purchase price or the appraised value as the property’s value.

The following are **ineligible**:
- Mortgages with interested party contributions **paid outside of closing** and not disclosed on the Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement.
