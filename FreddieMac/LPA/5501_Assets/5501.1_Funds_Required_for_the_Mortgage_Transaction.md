## (a) Verification of Borrower Funds for a Purchase Transaction  

For purchase Mortgages, the Seller must verify that the Borrower has sufficient funds to:  
- Pay any required Borrower contributions (Down Payment, Closing Costs, debt payoff or paydown)  
- Meet any reserve requirements  

Funds required to be paid by the Borrower include **all amounts** needed for the transaction and any verified reserves.

## (b) Verification of Borrower Funds for a Refinance Transaction  

For refinance Mortgages, the Seller must verify sufficient funds when **any** of the following apply:  
- Borrower must contribute **more than $500** toward Closing Costs or debt paydown;  
- Reserves are required by the transaction or Feedback Certificate; or  
- The Mortgage is **Manually Underwritten**.  

Funds must cover any Borrower contribution and required reserves.

## (c) Eligible Sources of Funds  

All verified funds must come from **eligible sources** listed in:

- The **Settlement/Closing Disclosure** shows that an **Escrow account** is established, and  
- The Escrow includes the seller’s prorated share of taxes for their period of ownership.  

In that case, the prorated seller tax credit offsets the Borrower’s Escrow charge.
