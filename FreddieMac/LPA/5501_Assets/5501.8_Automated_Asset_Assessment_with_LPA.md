Representation and warranty relief eligibility is contingent upon the Seller’s compliance with the requirements of this section.

**Asset and Income Modeler (AIM) automated asset assessment** using account data provides Sellers with the option to use **Loan Product Advisor® (LPA)** to determine eligibility for relief from enforcement of certain representations and warranties related to Borrower assets.

The Seller must:

LPA will assess representation and warranty relief eligibility and return the results on the **Feedback Certificate**.
