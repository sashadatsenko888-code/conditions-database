Section: 5605.5 – Improvements Analysis  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

---

## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s requirements for analyzing **improvements**, including property condition, quality of construction, required permits, unusual floor plans, rehabilitated or renovated properties, non-traditional property types, and outbuildings.  
The appraiser must provide an accurate and holistic evaluation of improvements that affect the market value and marketability of the subject property.

---

## (a) Property Condition and Quality of Construction
The appraisal report must:
- Accurately describe the improvements  
- Identify any factors affecting market value or marketability  
- Assign **condition (C1–C6)** and **quality (Q1–Q6)** ratings per **Exhibit 36 – Condition and Quality Ratings and Level of Updating Definitions** (for UAD reports)

When selecting condition and quality ratings, the appraiser must:
1. Evaluate **all improvements holistically** to determine overall condition and quality.  
2. If any portion of the property has **Q6-level quality**, the overall quality rating must be **Q6**.  
3. If any portion shows **C5 or C6-level deficiencies**, the property must be rated **C5 or C6**.  
4. Describe the property **on an absolute basis** as of the effective appraisal date — not relative to other properties.  
5. Provide clear commentary explaining the ratings, ensuring intended users can understand the appraiser’s reasoning.

---

### (i) Properties Consistent with a Q6 Quality Rating
- Properties rated **Q6** are **not acceptable collateral** for sale to Freddie Mac unless all issues causing the Q6 rating are cured **before delivery**.  
- If repairs will be completed before delivery, the appraisal must be reported **“subject to” repairs** and reflect the **hypothetical condition** post-repair.

**Examples of Q6 Characteristics**
- Uninhabitable as a year-round residence  
- Minimal or non-existent electrical, plumbing, or mechanical systems  
- Substandard structural additions  
- Other deficiencies making the property unacceptable to typical market participants  

**Exceptions – Q6 Issues May Be Cured After Settlement if:**
- The loan is a **CHOICERenovation®** or **CHOICEReno eXPress®** Mortgage (Sections 4607.1(b) / 4607.1(c)) and:
  - The deficiencies are cured through eligible renovations under Section 4607.6; or  
- The property is delivered as **incomplete improvements** per Section 5601.3.

---

### (ii) Properties with Deficiencies Consistent with a C5 or C6 Condition Rating
- Properties rated **C5** or **C6** are **not acceptable collateral** unless all deficiencies are cured prior to delivery.  
- The appraisal must be completed **“subject to” repairs**, reflecting the **hypothetical condition** after remediation.

**Examples of C5 / C6 Deficiencies**
- Active roof leaks  
- Incomplete remodel or construction (missing cabinetry, fixtures, etc.)  
- Missing or damaged exterior components allowing water intrusion  
- Exposed framing or missing drywall (except basements)  
- Standing water, water intrusion, or major plumbing leaks  
- Uncapped or unsafe electrical wiring  
- Missing or severely damaged floor coverings in primary areas  
- Foundation failure or damage  
- Non-functional mechanical systems  
- Failed sanitary system  

**Exceptions – C5 / C6 Issues May Be Cured After Settlement if:**
- The Mortgage is a **CHOICERenovation®** or **CHOICEReno eXPress®** loan, and the deficiencies are part of approved renovations; or  
- The property qualifies as **incomplete improvements** under Section 5601.3.

---

### (iii) Appraisal Reports Completed “Subject To” an Inspection
If property conditions warrant further investigation, the appraisal must be completed **“subject to” inspection** by a qualified licensed professional or relevant specialist.

**Examples of Conditions Requiring Inspection**
- Severe cracks in foundation or walls  
- Evidence of pest or insect infestation  
- Potentially contaminated water source  

The Seller must retain evidence of completed repairs or an inspection report confirming no corrective action is required.  
(See Section 5605.8 for additional “subject to” requirements.)

---

### (iv) Existing Properties with Minor Repairs or Deferred Maintenance
Appraisal reports may be completed **“as is”** if only minor repairs or maintenance items exist.  
The appraiser must make value adjustments where appropriate and include commentary.

**Examples of Minor Repairs / Deferred Maintenance**
- Worn flooring or finishes  
- Minor window cracks  
- Light wall damage  
- Missing interior doors or hardware  
- Missing screens or cabinetry doors  
- Damaged trim or countertops  
- Minor plumbing leaks (e.g., dripping faucets)  
- Missing handrails, light fixtures, or faceplates  
- Deteriorated sidewalks  

---

## (b) Required Permits
If additions or alterations were made **without required permits**, the appraiser must:
- Comment on the **quality and appearance** of the work,  
- Indicate whether the lack of permits affects value or marketability.

---

## (c) Unusual Floor Plans
Unusual layouts (e.g., tandem bedrooms, bathrooms off kitchens) **do not automatically make a property ineligible**.  
The appraisal must:
- Comment on whether similar floor plans exist in the Market Area,  
- Use **comparable properties** with similar design obsolescence, if available,  
- Demonstrate that the design remains **marketable and supported by market data**.

---

## (d) Rehabilitated or Renovated Properties
For properties recently **rehabilitated or renovated**, the appraisal report must:
- Identify and describe **specific improvements made**,  
- Include **photographs** of the completed rehabilitation or renovation per **Section 5604.2(a)**.

---

## (e) Non-Conformity to the Neighborhood and Non-Traditional or Unique Property Types
When the subject property differs significantly from the surrounding Neighborhood (type, design, materials, or construction technique):
- The appraisal must address **the effect on value and marketability**.

Freddie Mac accepts Mortgages secured by **non-traditional or unique property types**, such as:
- Barndominiums (barn conversions or barn-style homes)  
- Shouses (shop-house hybrids)  
- Berm homes  
- Log homes  
- Geodesic domes  

The appraisal must include **comparable sales** demonstrating that the property type is **marketable**.  
If traditional homes are used as comparables, the appraiser must:
- Identify and adjust for design differences,  
- Provide **supporting justification** for their inclusion.  

(See Section 5601.5 for **mixed-use** analysis requirements.)

---

## (f) Outbuildings on a Property
The Seller must determine whether the property is **primarily residential or non-residential**, based on the size and use of any outbuildings.

**Acceptable Examples**
- Small barns or stables are permitted if their **contributory value is minimal** relative to total appraised value.  
- The appraisal must include **comparable sales** demonstrating that similar outbuildings are **typical for residential properties** in the Market Area.

**Ineligible Examples**
- Large barns, silos, or multiple agricultural outbuildings that indicate **commercial or farm use**, even if not assigned separate value.
