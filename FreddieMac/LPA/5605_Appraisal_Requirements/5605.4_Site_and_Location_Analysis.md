## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s requirements for the **site and location analysis** within an appraisal report.  
It defines how the appraiser must evaluate **property characteristics**, **zoning**, **utilities**, **streets**, **site size**, **flood zones**, and **environmental or detrimental conditions** affecting the property or Neighborhood.

---

## (a) Property Characteristics
The “Site” section of the appraisal report must accurately describe:
- Physical characteristics of the site  
- Site improvements and view  
- Availability and adequacy of utilities  
- Locational factors influencing market value  

---

### (i) Zoning
The appraisal report must include:
- Zoning classification  
- Description of the classification  
- Determination of whether the land use is:
  - **Legal use**
  - **Legal non-conforming (grandfathered)**
  - **Illegal use**, or  
  - **No zoning**

#### (A) Eligible Zoning Classification
Freddie Mac does not restrict eligibility based on zoning type; however, the Seller must ensure that:
- The property’s **use is residential in nature**, and  
- The use is **permissible** under the zoning classification.  

**Example:**  
If the property is zoned **agricultural**, the Seller must confirm it is used as a residence and not primarily for commercial farming or ranching activities.

#### (B) Eligible Zoning Compliance
- Zoning compliance must be **legal** or **legal non-conforming**.  
- A **1-unit property with an ADU** having **illegal zoning** may still be eligible if Section 5601.2 requirements are met.  
- **2- or 3-unit properties with ADUs** must have legal or legal non-conforming zoning.  
- **4-unit properties with ADUs** are **not eligible**.  
- Properties in **jurisdictions with no zoning** are acceptable if all other conditions are met.  
- If land use is **legal non-conforming**, the appraisal report must analyze any **adverse effect on value**.  
- Properties affected by **coastal tideland, wetland, or setback laws** that prevent rebuilding after damage are **ineligible** for sale to Freddie Mac.

---

### (ii) Highest and Best Use
For a Mortgage to be eligible for sale to Freddie Mac:
- The **highest and best use** of the property (as improved or proposed) must be **its current use**.

---

### (iii) Utilities
The appraisal report must:
- Describe **utilities permanently connected** to the site  
- Evaluate their **impact on value and marketability**  
- Confirm utilities **meet community standards**

Comparable sales should reflect **similar utility services**.  
If there are differences in utilities, the appraiser must:
- Explain adjustments (or lack thereof)  
- Describe how the differences affect market value or marketability  

---

### (iv) Streets
The subject property must have **legal ingress and egress** via streets that:
- Are constructed and maintained to **community standards**  
- Provide **safe and practical access**

Refer to **Section 4702.4(e)** for private road or easement requirements.

If street access, ownership, or materials differ between the subject property and comparables:
- The appraiser must **justify and support adjustments**  
- The appraisal report must include **commentary on value or marketability impact**

---

### (v) Site Size
Freddie Mac imposes **no limit on site size**.  
The appraisal report must:
- State the **total site area**  
- Use comparable sales with **similar site sizes**  

If significant size differences exist:
- The appraiser must **explain any adjustments or absence thereof**,  
- And analyze how the difference affects **value or marketability**.

---

### (vi) Flood Hazard Area
The “Flood Hazard” section of the appraisal report is **not required** if the flood zone is determined by another qualified party (e.g., surveyor or flood zone company).  

If the property lies within a **Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)** per **FEMA**:
- The appraisal report must describe any **impact on value or marketability**.  

See **Section 4703.3** for flood zone determination and insurance requirements.

---

## (b) Environmental Issues and Detrimental Conditions

### (i) Contaminated Sites, Hazardous Substances, and Other Adverse Conditions
If the Seller is aware of a **Contaminated Site** in the Neighborhood, this must be disclosed to the appraiser when ordering the appraisal.

The appraisal report must:
- Identify any known **environmental hazards** (e.g., contaminated sites, hazardous substances)  
- Include **adjustments and commentary** for any resulting effect on **market value** or **marketability**

**Examples of issues requiring analysis:**
- Presence of asbestos, urea-formaldehyde, or similar insulation  
- Proximity to:
  - Contaminated sites  
  - Groundwater contamination, chemical or petroleum spills  
  - Industrial facilities  
  - Waste or water treatment plants  
  - Airports or approach paths  
  - Floodplains or landslide zones  
  - Other adverse environmental influences  

---

### (ii) Detrimental Conditions
The appraisal report must identify **detrimental site or area conditions**, such as:
- Expansive soils  
- Underground mines  
- Land subsidence  

If a detrimental condition exists **on the subject site**, the appraisal must be made **“subject to” an inspection** by:
- A **licensed professional**, or  
- Another **qualified specialist** in the field of concern  

The appraiser must analyze how the condition affects **value and marketability**.

For appraisals made **subject to repairs or inspections**, the Seller must include in the Mortgage file:
- **Evidence of repair or alteration**, or  
- An **inspection report** confirming that no corrective action is required  

(Refer to **Section 5605.8** for additional guidance on “subject to” appraisal reports.)
