## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s appraisal requirements for **special property types**, including:

- 2- to 4-unit properties  
- Condominium Units  
- Manufactured Homes  
- Leasehold Estates  
- Cooperative Share Loans  

Each property type has unique reporting standards and form requirements within the Freddie Mac appraisal process.

---

## (a) 2- to 4-Unit Properties
Appraisals for 2- to 4-unit properties must be completed on **Form 72 – Small Residential Income Property Appraisal Report** and must include rental, income, and market analyses consistent with Freddie Mac’s standards.

### (i) Comparable Rent Data
- The appraisal must analyze **at least three comparable rentals** in the *Comparable Rental Data* section.  
- Comparable rentals must:
  - Contain **current rental information**,  
  - Be **similar in size, type, and location** to the subject property.  
- The appraisal must clearly state that the chosen rental comparables **represent the local rental market** for both unit type and property characteristics, unless otherwise noted.

### (ii) Rent Schedule
- The *Rent Schedule* must list both:
  - **Actual current rents** for each unit, and  
  - **Estimated market rents**, supported by market data and consistent with information elsewhere in the report.  
- The appraiser must provide a clear rationale for any variance between actual and market rent.

### (iii) Sales Comparison Approach
- The appraisal must include **unadjusted units of comparison** for each comparable sale, such as:
  - **Sale price per square foot** of gross building area  
  - **Sale price per unit**  
  - **Sale price per room**  
  - **Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)**  

- For **purchase transactions**, the report must also include these units of comparison for the **subject property** itself.  

- In the *Sales Comparison Analysis* section, the appraiser must:
  - Reconcile **adjusted sale prices** and **unadjusted units of comparison**,  
  - Explain which factors (e.g., price per unit, GRM) are **most relevant to investors or purchasers** in that market.
