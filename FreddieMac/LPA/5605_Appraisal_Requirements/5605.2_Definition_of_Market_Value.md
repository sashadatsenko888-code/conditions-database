## Overview
This section defines the **market value standard** that must be applied in all appraisals prepared for Freddie Mac.  
The appraiser must base the opinion of market value on the following definition and ensure that the analysis and conclusions reflect a competitive, open, and fair market environment.

## Definition of Market Value
> “The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus.”

Implicit in this definition is the completion of a sale as of a specified date and the transfer of title from seller to buyer under conditions where:

- Buyer and seller are **typically motivated**  
- Both parties are **well informed or well advised**, acting in their own best interests  
- A **reasonable time** is allowed for exposure to the open market  
- Payment is made in **cash (U.S. dollars)** or in comparable **financial arrangements**  
- The price reflects **normal consideration**, unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions offered by anyone associated with the transaction  

---

## Adjustments for Financing and Concessions
- Adjustments to comparable sales must be made for **special or creative financing** or **sales concessions**.  
- No adjustments are needed for **customary seller-paid costs** that are standard in the Market Area and are typically included in all transactions.  
- Adjustments should reflect the **market’s reaction** to the concession, not a simple dollar-for-dollar cost comparison.  
- When comparable properties involve special financing, the adjustment should be based on the terms offered by a **third-party institutional lender** not connected with the property or transaction.

## Exclusion of Personal Property
The **market value estimate** of the subject property must **exclude** any value attributable to:
- Furniture  
- Personal property  
- Any non-realty items not permanently affixed to the property
