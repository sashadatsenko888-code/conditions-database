Section: 5605.7 – Cost and Income Approaches and Reconciliation of Market Value  
Effective Date: 06/04/2025  

---

## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s requirements for applying the **Cost Approach**, **Income Approach**, and the **Reconciliation of Market Value**.  
The appraisal report must include any valuation approach necessary to produce a **credible opinion of value**, even if not specifically requested by the Seller.

The Seller may instruct the appraiser to develop and report the cost or income approach, even if the approach is not required for a specific transaction.

---

## (a) Cost Approach
- The **Cost Approach** is **required only** for appraisals of **Manufactured Homes**.  
  (See Section 5703.9(e) for Manufactured Home requirements.)

- For other property types, the cost approach is **optional** and may be developed to support the Sales Comparison Approach, particularly when:
  - The market area includes **unique or atypical property styles**;  
  - There is a **limited supply of comparable sales**; or  
  - The subject has **distinctive features** (e.g., outbuildings, stables, pole barns, or shops).

**Appropriate use cases:**
- Newly constructed or proposed properties  
- Properties currently under renovation  
- Properties with unique design, construction, or materials (e.g., barndominiums, shouses, berm homes, log homes, or geodesic domes)  
- Properties exhibiting **functional obsolescence** or atypical characteristics for the Market Area  

> Note: Appraisal reports that rely **solely** on the cost approach are **not acceptable**, except for HeritageOne® Mortgages (see Section 4504.9 for HeritageOne requirements).

Freddie Mac does **not require** the appraiser to estimate **remaining economic life** for any property type.

---

## (b) Income Approach
- The **Income Approach** is **required** for appraisals of **2- to 4-unit properties**.  
- It is **optional** for 1-unit properties or condominiums when the income capitalization method is relevant to market participants.  
- Appraisals that rely **solely** on the income approach for the opinion of market value are **unacceptable**.

---

## (c) Reconciliation of Market Value
The reconciliation is the appraiser’s analysis that ties together the results of the different valuation approaches.

**Requirements:**
1. The final opinion of value must be **fully supported** by the data, methodologies, and reasoning presented in the appraisal.  
2. The appraisal must clearly explain **how** the appraiser derived the final value conclusion and **why** one approach was given more weight than another.  
3. The rationale must be consistent with all comments, conclusions, and assumptions within the appraisal.  
4. The reconciliation must identify any **conditions** or **assumptions** that affect the final value conclusion.

If the subject transaction includes **sales or financing concessions**, the appraiser’s opinion of market value must:
- Reflect the value of the property **exclusive of those concessions**, and  
- State the **dollar amount** of the concessions as a separate comment within the report.
