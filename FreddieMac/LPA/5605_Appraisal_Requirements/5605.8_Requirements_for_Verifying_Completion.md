## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s requirements for verifying **completion of construction, repairs, or alterations**, and for documenting **inspections** when required.  

The requirements apply to:

- Existing properties subject to repairs or alterations  
- Appraisal reports or PDRs that require a professional inspection

## (a) Verifying Completion for New or Proposed Construction
For appraisal reports of new or proposed construction that are **subject to completion per plans and specifications**, Freddie Mac will accept one of the following as verification:

1. **Form 442 – Appraisal Update and/or Completion Report**, prepared by an appraiser, confirming completion per plans/specifications.  
   - Freddie Mac accepts a Form 442 completed by an **unlicensed appraiser or trainee** if a **supervisory appraiser** signs it.  
   - The inspection may be **on-site** or performed **virtually using technology** to document completion.

2. **Form 400 – Warranty of Completion of Construction or Repairs/Alterations**, or a substantially similar form, signed by **both the Borrower and the builder**, confirming the property was completed per plans/specifications.  
   - By delivering the signed Form 400, the **Seller represents and warrants** that construction was completed as specified, with **no material changes** after the appraisal’s effective date.  
   - If Form 400 cannot be obtained with both signatures, a Form 442 completed by the appraiser is required.
