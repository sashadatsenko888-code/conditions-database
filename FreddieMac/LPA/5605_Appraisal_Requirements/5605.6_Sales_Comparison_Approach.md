Section: 5605.6 – Sales Comparison Approach  
Effective Date: 06/04/2025

## Overview
Freddie Mac requires that **all appraisal reports** include a Sales Comparison Approach.  
This section outlines requirements for **adjustments, concessions, market analysis, market conditions, location, view, condition and quality, comparable sales selection and analysis,** and **sale/listing history**.

> For special appraisal requirements related to HeritageOne® Mortgages, see Section 4504.9.

---

## (a) Adjustments
- Each comparable sale must be analyzed for similarities and differences with the subject property.  
- When differences affect market value, the appraisal report must include **monetary adjustments** that reflect the **market’s perception of value**.  
- The appraiser must provide **clear rationale** for all adjustments—or lack thereof.  
- Adjustments are made **to comparable sales**, except for **sales and financing concessions**, which are adjusted based on their effect on the comparable sale’s price.  
- Large gross or net adjustment percentages are acceptable, especially in **rural markets or unique properties** with limited data.  
- Freddie Mac imposes **no adjustment percentage limits**.  
- See subsection (c) for market condition adjustments.

---

## (b) Sales and Financing Concessions
- The appraisal report must indicate how each sale was verified and whether concessions were granted.  
- Sales or financing concessions may be provided by **interested parties** (e.g., builder, developer, seller, or real estate agent).  
- Adjustments must be made for **special or creative financing** or **sales concessions**.  
- No adjustment is needed for costs **customarily paid by sellers** under local law or practice.  
- The adjustment must reflect the **actual market impact** of the concession—it may be **equal to, greater than, or less than** the concession’s nominal amount.  
- For seller treatment of concessions, see Section 5501.6.

---

## (c) Market Area Analysis and Market Condition Adjustments
- The market trend (**increasing, stable, or declining**) must be supported by at least **12 months of data** from reliable sources such as MLS, HPI, public records, or recognized models.  
- The market condition adjustment for a comparable may differ from the overall trend since it’s based on **market change between the contract date** of the comparable and the **effective date** of the appraisal.  

**Example:**  
The 12-month data shows an overall positive trend, but between the comparable’s contract date and the appraisal date, the market was stable or slightly declining.

- Recent comparable sales (contract dates close to the appraisal date) may **not require** a market condition adjustment.  
- The appraisal report must include **market analysis** that supports the trend and all applied adjustments.  
- Refer to **Exhibit 44 – Market Condition Adjustments** for detailed methodology.

---

## (d) Location
- For UAD-compliant forms, the location of the subject and each comparable must be rated as **Neutral (N)**, **Beneficial (B)**, or **Adverse (A)**.  
- The rating reflects the **influence of location** on value and marketability within the Market Area, not an evaluation of the Market Area itself.  
- See Appendix D – UAD Field Standardization Requirements for additional guidance.  

**Rural Markets:**  
- Often have fewer sales, larger lot sizes, and more property variation.  
- Older, more distant, or less similar comparables may be acceptable if the appraisal includes **supporting justification** and **appropriate adjustments**.

**Example:**  
If the subject is a ranch-style home on 44 acres, the best comparables may be two-story homes on 6–12 acres located 8–18 miles away.

---

## (e) View
- For UAD-compliant reports, the overall **view rating** must be indicated as **Neutral (N)**, **Beneficial (B)**, or **Adverse (A)**.  
- The view rating reflects the **overall effect of the property’s view** on value and marketability.  
- See Appendix D and Section 5606.1 for UAD view requirements.

---

## (f) Condition and Quality
- Adjustments must be made for differences in **condition** and **quality** between the subject and each comparable sale.  
- An adjustment may be appropriate even if both have the same **UAD quality or condition rating**, if observable differences exist — with **clear explanation** in the report.  
- See Section 5605.5 for property condition and construction quality, Section 5606.1 for UAD details, and Exhibit 36 for rating definitions.

---

## (g) Selection of Comparable Sales and Analysis
- The appraisal must include at least **three closed comparable sales**.  
- Additional comparables, **contract (pending) sales**, or **current listings** may be included to support the opinion of market value.  
- Ideally, comparable sales should have closed within **12 months**; older sales may be used if **justified** (especially if over 6 months).  
- Proper selection of comparables minimizes the need for—and size of—adjustments (typically based on **GLA, room count, quality, and site characteristics**).  
- The appraiser must determine whether the **Neighborhood** and **Market Area** are the same.  
  - If comparable sales are located **outside** the subject’s Market Area, the appraisal must include **rationale and location adjustments** as needed.  
- When few similar comparables exist, the appraiser may use the **most relevant available sales**, even from a **competing market area**.

---

### (i) Established Subdivisions, PUDs, and Established Condominium Projects
- For properties in established subdivisions, PUDs, or established condo projects, the appraisal should use **comparables within** the same community **when they are the best indicators of value**.  
- See Section 5705.8 for requirements related to **Cooperative Projects**.

---

### (ii) New Subdivisions, New PUDs, and Recently Converted or New Condominium Projects
The appraisal must include:
- **At least one comparable sale** from **inside** the subject subdivision, PUD, or project (if available).  
  - This may be a **builder or developer sale** of a similar unit.  
  - If no closed sales are available, a **contract sale** from within the project may be used **in addition** to at least three closed sales from outside the project.  
  - If the project is brand new and has no closed or pending sales, **outside comparables** may be used with commentary justifying marketability and the selection.  
- **At least one comparable sale from outside** the subdivision, PUD, or project.  
- **At least two comparable sales** that were **not sold by the builder/developer** of the subject property.  
- For cooperative projects, see Section 5705.8.

---

## (h) Sale and Listing History
The appraiser must research, verify, and analyze:
- Any current purchase agreement for the subject property  
- Any active or prior listing within the **past 12 months**  
- Any sale or ownership transfer of the subject property within the **past 3 years**  
- Any sale or ownership transfer of each comparable within **1 year** before its sale date  

**Seller (Lender) responsibilities:**
- Evaluate the appraisal’s acceptability, ensuring the sale and listing history supports the appraised value.  
- For purchase transactions: compare the appraisal to the **current sales contract**.  
- For both purchase and refinance: review **current listings**, **ownership records**, and **recent sale history** of both the subject and comparables.  
- To mitigate fraud risk, analyze the **time between acquisitions and resales**, especially rapid resales at higher prices.  

If the sale history suggests potentially inflated or excessive pricing shortly after acquisition, the appraisal must provide **evidence** that supports:
- A rapidly appreciating market,  
- Significant improvements that justify the increase, or  
- That the prior sale was **below market value** (e.g., distress or tax sale).
