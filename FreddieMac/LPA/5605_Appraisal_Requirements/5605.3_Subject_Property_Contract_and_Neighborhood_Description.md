## Overview
This section defines the requirements for identifying and analyzing the **subject property**, **sales contract**, and **Neighborhood or Market Area** in the appraisal report.  
It ensures that property identification, legal description, and market context are clearly documented and meet Freddie Mac’s standards.

---

## (a) Identifying the Subject Property, Legal Description, Occupancy Status, Property Rights, Listing Information, and Lender/Client

### (i) Subject Property Address and Owner of Record
- The “Subject” section of the appraisal report must include:  
  - The **complete property address**  
  - The **legal description**  
  - The **owner of public record**  

- For appraisal reports prepared using the **Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD)**, the address format must comply with **U.S. Postal Service Publication 28** (see Section 5606.1).

---

### (ii) Legal Description
Each appraisal report must include the legal description of the subject property.  
If lengthy, it may be provided as an addendum.  
The legal description must match that used in the:
- Security Instrument  
- Title insurance policy or other title evidence  
- Mortgage, survey, lease, and related documentation  

#### Acceptable Legal Description Formats
**(A) Metes and Bounds**
- Beginning point must reference a fixed monument.  
- Each boundary must specify **distances and bearings** (or interior angles).  
- Based on a **recent instrument survey** by a licensed civil engineer or surveyor.  
- Curved boundaries must identify **arc length, radius, and chord distance/bearing**.  
- A single perimeter description is required for the entire plot.  
- Division into parcels is prohibited unless:
  - The property crosses a public way, or  
  - An easement appurtenant is customary.

**(B) Lot and Block**
- Must reference a **recorded map or plat** showing the lot(s) or block(s).  
- When multiple plats are used, their alignment must be fixed by identical monuments.

**(C) Additional Acceptable Forms**
- Legal descriptions bounded entirely by **public streets or alleys** may refer to those lines.  
- Registered property under a **Torrens Act** is acceptable if in the required local format.

**(D) Consistency**
- The legal description must be **consistent across all documents** (Mortgage, title, survey, insurance, etc.).

---

### (iii) Occupancy Status, Property Rights, and Listing Information
- The appraisal report must specify:
  - **Occupancy status** – owner, tenant, or vacant  
  - **Property rights appraised** – fee simple or leasehold  
  - Whether the property **is or was listed for sale** within the past 12 months  
- Must include:
  - **Data sources**, offering price(s), date(s), and days on market  

---

### (iv) Lender/Client Identification
- The appraisal report must identify the **lender** on the “Lender/Client” line.  
- If applicable, any **Appraisal Management Company (AMC)** must be disclosed in the **appraiser’s certification section**.

---

## (b) Contract Analysis
The **contract for sale** must include:
- Sale or contract price  
- Date of contract  
- Any **loan charges**, **sales concessions**, or **financing assistance** paid by the seller or other interested parties  

The Seller must ensure the **complete contract** is provided to the appraiser with the appraisal order, regardless of who orders the report.

### Appraiser’s Contract Analysis Requirements
The “Contract” section of the appraisal report must include:
- Appraiser’s analysis of the sale contract  
- Contract price and date  
- Confirmation whether the seller is the **owner of record**, including data source(s)  
- Total dollar amount and description of **any financial assistance** (e.g., concessions, gifts, or Down Payment assistance)

For **UAD appraisal reports**, the “Contract” section must identify the **type of sale**, such as:
> REO sale, short sale, court-ordered sale, estate sale, relocation sale, non-arm’s length sale, or arm’s length sale.  
(Refer to Section 5606.1.)

---

## (c) Neighborhood Description and Analysis
The “Neighborhood” section must include:
- Defined **Neighborhood boundaries**  
- Classification as **Urban**, **Suburban**, or **Rural**  
- Degree of development (**Over 75%**, **25–75%**, or **Under 25%**)  
- **Growth rate** designation – Rapid, Stable, or Slow  
- Summary of **market conditions**, **one-unit housing trends**, **price/age ranges**, and **current land uses**

---

### (i) Market Area Analysis
Properties in **urban, suburban, or rural Market Areas** are eligible if they are **adequate collateral** based on:
- Value  
- Condition  
- Marketability  

The appraisal report must include the **appraiser’s narrative explanation** of their conclusions.

---

### (ii) Neighborhood or Market Area Characteristics
Neighborhood and Market Area features must be analyzed **in context** of the subject property’s location.

**Examples:**
- Urban areas often include **mixed-use properties** (e.g., residential/commercial).  
- Rural areas may include **agricultural zoning**, **large parcels**, and **outbuildings**.  

When analyzing the Neighborhood or Market Area, the appraiser must consider the presence of:
- Mixed-use properties  
- Non-residential properties or land uses  
- Agricultural or undeveloped land  

> The existence of non-residential or mixed-use elements **does not make residential properties ineligible** for Freddie Mac delivery.

**Example:**  
A property in a rural area where agricultural activity is prevalent may still qualify as residential collateral if the appraiser determines its **primary use and characteristics are residential**.
