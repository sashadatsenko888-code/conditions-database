  - **Executed by the Warehouse Lender**,  
  - **In recordable form**, and  
  - **Effective on or before the Settlement Date** of the Pledged Mortgage.

- The Seller must then **promptly record** this reassignment **in the public records** of the appropriate jurisdiction **after Settlement**.

### (ii) If the Assignment *Was Not Recorded*:
- The **Warehouse Lender** must **return the unrecorded assignment** to the Seller **before the Settlement Date**.

### (i) Termination Statement Filed:
- The Seller must obtain a **termination statement (UCC-3)** executed by the Warehouse Lender.  
- The Seller must then **promptly file** this termination statement **in the public records** of the appropriate jurisdiction **after Settlement**.
