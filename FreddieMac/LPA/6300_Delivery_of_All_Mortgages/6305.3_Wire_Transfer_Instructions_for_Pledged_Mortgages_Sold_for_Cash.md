## (c) Freddie Mac Discretion to Postpone Funding
Freddie Mac may **delay the Funding Date** at its sole discretion if:

1. **Form 987E** (wire instructions) is **not received in time**,  
2. **Form 996E** (Warehouse Lender’s release or transfer) is **not received in time**,

   - Not received in time for user setup in Loan Selling Advisor®,  
   - Contains unreliable or unverifiable information, or

In such cases, **Freddie Mac may postpone the Funding Date** until all documentation and authorizations are properly executed and validated.
