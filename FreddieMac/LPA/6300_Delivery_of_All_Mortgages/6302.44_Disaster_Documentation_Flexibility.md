Section: 6302.44 – Special Delivery Requirements for Mortgages Utilizing the Age of Documentation Flexibility in Eligible Disaster Areas  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section specifies the **delivery requirements** for **Mortgages secured by properties in Eligible Disaster Areas (EDAs)** that make use of Freddie Mac’s **age of documentation flexibility**.  
This flexibility allows Sellers to use **older verification documents** (such as income, assets, or employment records) when normal document expiration periods are temporarily extended due to a **federally declared disaster**.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- Refer to **Section 4407.3** for complete eligibility criteria for **age of documentation flexibilities** applicable to properties located in **Eligible Disaster Areas (EDAs)**.  
- This delivery requirement applies only when the Seller has used extended document-age allowances under disaster-related guidance.  

---

## (b) Data Delivery Instructions

When a Mortgage **uses extended documentation age flexibility** due to an **Eligible Disaster Area**, the Seller must deliver the following ULDD data element:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **LOAN – Current → Product Details** | 368 | **Investor Feature Identifier = H37** | Indicates that the Mortgage used extended document-age eligibility under Freddie Mac disaster relief provisions. |

---

## Key Logic
| Scenario | ULDD Field | Valid Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Property in an Eligible Disaster Area and Seller used aged income, employment, or asset documentation per §4407.3 | 368 | H37 | Identifies use of “Age of Documentation Flexibility.” |

---

## Checklist
- [ ] Verify property is located in a **Freddie Mac–defined Eligible Disaster Area**.  
- [ ] Confirm use of extended **documentation age allowances** under §4407.3.  
- [ ] Deliver **Investor Feature Identifier = H37** in ULDD file.  
- [ ] Do **not** deliver H37 for loans where documentation met normal age requirements.
