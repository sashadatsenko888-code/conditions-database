> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview
This section defines **data delivery**, **recourse**, and **credit enhancement** reporting requirements for **Refi Possible® Mortgages**.  
These loans are Freddie Mac’s **affordable refinance option** designed to help lower-income Borrowers refinance an existing Freddie Mac-owned loan.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- See **Section 4302.5** for **eligibility criteria** for Refi Possible Mortgages.  
- The refinanced loan must meet Freddie Mac’s “no cash-out” refinance definition and must refinance an **existing Freddie Mac-owned loan**.  
- Loan data must identify the original Freddie Mac loan number being refinanced.

## (b) Data Delivery Instructions

### Data Required for Refi Possible® Mortgages

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **LOAN – At Closing → Loan Details** | | | |
| 315 | **Loan Purpose Type** | `Refinance` | Required for all Refi Possible Mortgages. |
| 294 | **Refinance Cash Out Determination Type** | `No Cash Out` | Must indicate no cash-out purpose. |
| **→ Streamlined Loan Details** | | | |
| 222 | **Related Loan Investor Type** | `FRE` | Indicates the refinanced loan was owned by Freddie Mac. |
| 221 | **Related Investor Loan Identifier** | `<Associated FRE Loan #>` | The 9-digit Freddie Mac loan number assigned to the original Mortgage when it was first sold. |
| **LOAN – Current → Product Details** | | | |
| 368 | **Investor Feature Identifier** | `J05` | Identifies the loan as a **Refi Possible Mortgage**. |

---

## (c) Delivery of Mortgages with Recourse or Indemnification

If the **Mortgage being refinanced** had **recourse** or **indemnification**, apply the following logic:

| Scenario | ULDD Field | Valid Value | Description |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Original Mortgage had **recourse for life of loan** | 368 | `001` | Indicates Refi Possible Mortgage sold with recourse. |
| Original Mortgage had **indemnification for life of loan** | 368 | `033` | Indicates Refi Possible Mortgage sold with indemnification. |
| Original Mortgage had **temporary credit enhancement** (recourse/indemnification for less than loan life) | 368 | *Do not deliver `001` or `033`* | Freddie Mac internally manages transfer of credit enhancement — no delivery required. |

---

## (d) Delivery of Mortgages with Credit Enhancements for Less than the Life of the Mortgage
If the **refinanced Mortgage** was originally sold with **limited-term credit enhancements**, such as temporary indemnification or recourse:
- **Do not** deliver **any Investor Feature Identifier** indicating credit enhancement.
- Freddie Mac will **automatically manage** credit enhancement transfer for the Refi Possible Mortgage.

---

## Key Logic
| Scenario | Required Field(s) | Value(s) | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|--------|
| Refi Possible loan delivery | 368 | `J05` | Identifies program. |
| Refinance of Freddie Mac loan | 222 = FRE, 221 = `<FRE Loan #>` | Original Freddie Mac loan must be referenced. |
| Recourse (lifetime) | 368 = `001` | Add only if original loan had lifetime recourse. |
| Indemnification (lifetime) | 368 = `033` | Add only if original loan had lifetime indemnification. |
| Temporary credit enhancement | Exclude 001 / 033 | Freddie Mac handles automatically. |

---

## Checklist
- [ ] Verify **loan is a Freddie Mac-to-Freddie Mac refinance** (§4302.5).  
- [ ] Confirm **Loan Purpose = Refinance** and **No Cash Out**.  
- [ ] Include **Related Investor Loan Identifier (221)** with valid 9-digit Freddie Mac loan number.  
- [ ] Assign **Investor Feature Identifier J05** to tag the loan as Refi Possible.  
- [ ] If recourse or indemnification applies, determine if **lifetime** or **temporary** and deliver correct indicator.  
- [ ] Exclude credit enhancement flags if they were **not permanent**.
