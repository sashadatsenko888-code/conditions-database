## Key Logic
| Scenario | ULDD Field | Valid Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Borrower completed CreditSmart® Homebuyer U | 576 = “Government Agency”, 578 = “Home Study” | Indicates Freddie Mac online course. |
| Borrower attended group class | 576 = “HUD Approved Counseling Agency”, 578 = “Classroom” | Instructor-led group session. |
| Borrower received one-on-one education | 576 = “HUD Approved Counseling Agency”, 578 = “Individual” | Personalized counseling. |
| Borrower not required to participate (refinance) | 576 = “No Borrower Counseling”, 578 = “Borrower Education Not Required” | No homeownership education required. |
| Borrower did not participate, but co-borrower did | 576 = “Other – Borrower Did Not Participate”, 578 = “Other – Borrower Did Not Participate” | Indicates secondary borrower exemption. |

---
