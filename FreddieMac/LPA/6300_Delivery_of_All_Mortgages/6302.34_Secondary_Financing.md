## Key Logic
| Scenario | Required ULDD Field | Value / Action |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|
| Any secondary financing | Loan Role Type = “Related Loan” | Must identify lien relationship. |
| Closed-end second | HELOC Indicator = false | Fixed balance subordinate lien. |
| HELOC | HELOC Indicator = true | Must include max and disbursed balances. |
| Affordable Second | Loan Affordable Indicator = true | Indicates subsidized subordinate financing. |
| Affordable Second (gift entry, LPA ≤ 4.8.01) | Investor Feature Identifier = G18 | Identifies gift fund equivalence. |
| Affordable Second (specific source) | Investor Feature Identifier = J07 or J54 | Flags allowed source type. |
| Deferred payment Affordable Second | Initial P&I Payment = 0 | Reflects payment deferral period. |

---
