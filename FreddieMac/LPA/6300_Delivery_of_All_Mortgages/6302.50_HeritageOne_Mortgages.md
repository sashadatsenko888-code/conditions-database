---

### (iii) HeritageOne Mortgages Originated with Sweat Equity
If the HeritageOne Mortgage was originated using **sweat equity** (borrower labor contribution) as a **credit toward Down Payment and/or Closing Costs**, deliver the following additional ULDD field:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **LOAN – Current → Product Details** | 368 | `Investor Feature Identifier = J11` | Identifies the Mortgage as having **Duty to Serve (DTS) sweat equity** credit. |

## Key Logic

|-----------|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| HeritageOne loan in Tribal Area | 404 | HeritageOne | Identifies HeritageOne program. |
| Property on tribal or leasehold land | 63 | Fee Simple / Leasehold | Must reflect correct estate type. |
| Borrower education completed via CreditSmart® | 576/577 = Government Agency, 578/579 = HomeStudy | CreditSmart Homebuyer U qualifies as Government Agency / HomeStudy. |
| Mortgage includes sweat equity | 368 | J11 | Required if borrower used sweat equity credit. |
| Secondary financing (Affordable Second) | — | See 6302.34 | Apply all ULDD secondary lien requirements. |
