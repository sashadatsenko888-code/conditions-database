## Overview
This section outlines **data delivery requirements** for **Mortgages with builder forward commitments** — loans where the **interest rate** is based on a **forward commitment** made by a builder to deliver multiple new-construction homes at predetermined pricing or terms.  

---

## (a) General Requirements
- See **Section 5501.6** for full eligibility and operational requirements related to **builder forward commitments**.  
- These typically apply to **new construction properties** where a **builder and lender have a prior rate commitment agreement** to support homebuyer financing.  

---

## (b) Data Delivery Instructions
For Mortgages with builder forward commitments, Sellers must deliver the following ULDD Data Points:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **LOAN – At Closing → Loan Details** | 315 | **Loan Purpose Type = Purchase** | The Mortgage must be reported as a **purchase transaction**. |
| **LOAN – Current → Product Details** | 368 | **Investor Feature Identifier = J70** | Indicates that the Mortgage is **secured by new construction** and the **rate was provided under a builder forward commitment**. |

---

## Key Logic
| Scenario | Required Field(s) | Value(s) | Description |
