Section: 6305.2 – Delivery and Acceptance of Pledged Mortgages  
Effective Date: 10/02/2019  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section explains **how Freddie Mac handles Notes and ancillary documents** related to **Pledged Mortgages** under a **Warehouse Financing Arrangement**, and establishes that Freddie Mac’s recognition of interests is limited strictly to those created under a valid **Warehouse Agreement**.

---

## Core Principle

When a Seller delivers a **Pledged Mortgage** under a valid Warehouse Financing Arrangement:

- The **Document Custodian** will hold:
  - The **Note**, and  
  - Any **ancillary documents** (e.g., riders, assignments, modification agreements)  
  **for that Pledged Mortgage**.

- These documents are held **subject to the Warehouse Lender’s interest** created under the **Warehouse Agreement**,  
  **until Freddie Mac purchases the Mortgage**.

---

## Freddie Mac’s Legal Position

- Freddie Mac **only recognizes** the Warehouse Lender’s interest **as defined in the Warehouse Agreement**.
- Freddie Mac **does not recognize**:
  - Any **trust receipt**,  
  - Any **bailee letter**, or  
  - Any **other statement or instrument** asserting a continuing security interest or ownership beyond that stated in the Warehouse Agreement.

- Any such additional documentation (e.g., trust receipts or acknowledgments) has **no legal effect** on Freddie Mac’s custody or ownership status of the Mortgage.

## Custodial Status Summary

| Stage | Document Holder | Legal Status of Custody | Freddie Mac Recognition |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Before Freddie Mac purchase** | Document Custodian | Holds Note & ancillary docs **subject to Warehouse Lender’s interest** | Recognized per Warehouse Agreement only |
| **After Freddie Mac purchase** | Freddie Mac | Full ownership interest transferred | Warehouse Lender’s interest terminated |
| **If conflicting documents exist** | — | (e.g., trust receipt, bailee letter) | **Not recognized** by Freddie Mac |

---

## Compliance Implications
| Responsibility | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Seller** | Must ensure Warehouse Agreement governs all security or ownership interests. |
| **Warehouse Lender** | May rely solely on Warehouse Agreement for its pledge interest; cannot enforce additional trust receipts. |
| **Document Custodian** | Holds documents in trust under Freddie Mac direction; cannot act on any alternate statements of interest. |
| **Freddie Mac** | Recognizes only the pledge relationship as per the Warehouse Agreement and the Seller’s Purchase Contract. |
