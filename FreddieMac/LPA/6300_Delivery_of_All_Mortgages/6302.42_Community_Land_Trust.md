Section: 6302.42 – Special Delivery Requirements for Community Land Trust Mortgages  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines the **data delivery requirements** for **Community Land Trust (CLT) Mortgages**, which are loans secured by properties where the land is owned by a **Community Land Trust** and leased to the homeowner through a **long-term ground lease**.  
Freddie Mac requires specific ULDD data elements to correctly classify, identify, and pool these loans.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- Refer to **Chapter 4502** for **eligibility requirements** for Community Land Trust Mortgages.  
- Community Land Trust Mortgages must meet Freddie Mac’s leasehold and resale restriction standards.  
- Some CLT programs may be certified under **Fannie Mae’s Shared Equity Program list** — these require additional delivery identifiers.

---

## (b) Data Delivery Instructions

### (i) All Community Land Trust Mortgages
The Seller must deliver the following ULDD Data Points for **every CLT Mortgage**:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **PROPERTY → Property Details** | | | |
| 63 | Property Estate Type | **Leasehold** | Identifies that the property is held under a ground lease as part of a Community Land Trust. |
| **LOAN – Current → Product Details** | | | |
| 404 | Loan Program Identifier | **Community Land Trust** | Identifies the mortgage as a CLT Mortgage for Freddie Mac reporting and pooling. |

---

### (ii) CLT Mortgages under Certified Shared Equity Programs
For CLT Mortgages where the program is listed in **Fannie Mae’s Certified Shared Equity Program list** (per Section 4502.7), the Seller must deliver one additional ULDD Data Point:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **LOAN – Current → Product Details** | 368 | **Investor Feature Identifier = J73** | Indicates the CLT program is recognized in **Fannie Mae’s Certified Shared Equity Program list**. |

---

## (c) Delivery Programs
Community Land Trust Mortgages may be sold under:
- **Fixed-Rate Cash**  
- **Fixed-Rate Guarantor**  

> MultiLender Swap programs are **not authorized** for CLT delivery unless specifically negotiated.

---

## Key Logic
| Scenario | Required ULDD Fields | Description |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------|
| Any CLT Mortgage | 63 = Leasehold; 404 = Community Land Trust | Identifies CLT structure and leasehold property type. |
| CLT Program Certified (per Fannie Mae list) | 368 = J73 | Additional identifier for shared equity program inclusion. |

---

## Checklist
- [ ] Confirm property is under **leasehold ownership** through a Community Land Trust.  
- [ ] Verify compliance with **Chapter 4502** CLT eligibility standards.  
- [ ] If the CLT program appears on Fannie Mae’s **Certified Shared Equity Program list**, include **Investor Feature Identifier = J73**.  
- [ ] Deliver both **Property Estate Type = Leasehold** and **Loan Program Identifier = Community Land Trust**.
