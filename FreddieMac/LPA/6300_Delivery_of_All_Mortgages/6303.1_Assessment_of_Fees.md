## Overview
This section describes how Freddie Mac **assesses, bills, refunds, and recaptures fees** related to the sale and delivery of Mortgages, including **Credit Fees**, **buyup/buydown fees**, and **premium recapture**.  

It also defines the process for **monthly invoicing**, **ACH drafts**, and **adjustments** for data corrections, as well as penalties for exceeding Freddie Mac’s **Maximum Annual Mortgage Purchase Amount**.

## (a) Assessment of Fees

### (i) Credit Fees
Credit Fees are amounts charged by Freddie Mac for loans with specific risk characteristics.  
They are defined in **Exhibit 19 – Credit Fees** and governed by **Section 6303.2(a)**.

#### (A) Assessment
- Credit Fees are **assessed and billed** when Mortgages are sold.
- A Mortgage may be subject to **multiple cumulative Credit Fees**, unless otherwise specified in the Seller’s Purchase Documents.

#### (B) Calculation
- **Credit Fee in Price** = Credit Fee Rate × **UPB** (as of Funding/Settlement Date).

#### (C) Base Grid Credit Fees
- Determined using **Loan-to-Value (LTV)** and **Credit Score/Indicator Score**:
  - For **Loan Product Advisor® Mortgages (LPA)**:
    - Based on Freddie Mac’s LTV and the **Indicator Score** from the Last Feedback Certificate.
    - If **Key Number** is missing → Fee defaults to **Below 620 Base Grid Fee**.
  - For **Non-LPA Mortgages**:
    - Based on delivered **Indicator Score** and Freddie Mac’s calculated LTV.
    - If **Indicator Score** missing → Also assessed **Below 620 Base Grid Fee**.
  - For **Cash-Released XChange® deliveries**:
    - Seller must always deliver **Loan Level Credit Score Value**, used for Base Grid calculation.

#### (D) Changes to Credit Fees
Freddie Mac may, with written notice:
- Modify Credit Fee rates or credits.
- Adjust which Mortgages are subject to fees or eligible for credits.
- Add new Credit Fee categories.

---

### (ii) Buyup Proceeds and Buydown Fees
- Determined under **Section 6201.10(d)**.  
- Credit Fees are:
  - **Deducted** from buyup proceeds, or  
  - **Added** to buydown fees.  

---

### (iii) Gold Rush® Fees
| Contract Type | Applicable Section |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Fixed-Rate Guarantor | §6203.4 |
| WAC ARM Guarantor | §6204.4 |
| MultiLender Swap | §6205.2(a) |

---

### (iv) Monthly Invoice and Account Activity
- Questions → **SellerBilling@FreddieMac.com**  
- Freddie Mac issues **monthly invoices** summarizing all fees, adjustments, and ACH transactions.

#### (A) Monthly Invoice Process
1. **Cash Purchase Contracts**  
   - Freddie Mac nets **Credit Fees** and **credits** against the purchase price.  
   - Other fees (pairoff fees, premium recapture, etc.) appear on monthly invoice.

2. **Guarantor and MultiLender Swap Contracts**  
   - Initial fees (Credit Fees, buyups, buydowns, settlement interest) drafted **daily via ACH**.  
   - Monthly adjustments and pairoff/early payoff fees drafted **monthly via ACH**.

#### (B) Account Activity Statement
- Sent monthly with the invoice.  
- Includes:
  - Total account balance and due amount.  
  - Late fees (§6303.2(b)) for past-due accounts.  
  - Adjustments or credits from prior months.

---

## (b) Fee for Purchase Contracts Exceeding Maximum Annual Purchase Limit
If a Seller exceeds the **Maximum Annual Mortgage Purchase Amount**, Freddie Mac may:
- Rescind the Purchase Contract (§1201.4(b)).
- Assess a **reasonable fee** on the total contract amount rescinded.
- Fee must be remitted using the same process as **Credit Fees (§6303.2(a))**.

---

## (c) Refunds, Repayments, Credits, and Adjustments

### (i) Refunds for Repurchases
Freddie Mac may **refund** part or all Credit Fees within **12 months** if:
- The Mortgage is deemed **ineligible** for purchase.
- The Seller must **repurchase** the Mortgage.
- The Seller **voluntarily repurchases** the Mortgage with Freddie Mac’s approval.

> **Note:** Freddie Mac may apply a **processing fee** up to **0.5% of UPB**, capped at the refund amount.

If a refund is given, the Seller must **repay any Credit Fee credits** previously applied.

---

### (ii) Recalculation Adjustments
If data errors affecting Credit Fee or funding fee are discovered **within six months**:
- Freddie Mac recalculates the fees using corrected data.
- Resulting differences (owed/refunded/credited) appear on a later monthly invoice.
- Adjustments after six months are **at Freddie Mac’s discretion**.

---

## (d) Recapture of Premiums and Reimbursement of Buyup Proceeds
If a Mortgage pays off **within 120 days** of Funding/Settlement:
Freddie Mac may require repayment of the following:

| Delivery Channel | Fee Type | Calculation |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Cash Program** | **Premium Recapture Fee** | (Purchase Price − Par Price − Delivery Fees − ≤0.50% Processing Fee) × Outstanding UPB |
| **Guarantor / MultiLender Swap** | **Early Payoff Fee** | 1% × Outstanding UPB |
|  | **Buyup Proceeds Reimbursement** | 100% of prior buyup proceeds paid |

All recaptured amounts appear on the **monthly account statement** and are **ACH drafted** per §6303.2(a).
