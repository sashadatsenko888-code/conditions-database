Section: 6305.11 – Reimbursement by the Seller for Pledged Mortgages  
Effective Date: 03/02/2016  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview

This section establishes the Seller’s **financial responsibility** to **reimburse Freddie Mac** for any **reasonable expenses** Freddie Mac incurs in connection with the **delivery of Pledged Mortgages** through Warehouse Lenders.  

While Freddie Mac does **not impose additional program fees** beyond those already specified in the Guide, **the Seller must cover incidental costs** arising from the handling, transfer, or verification of Pledged Mortgages.

---

## (a) No Additional Standard Fees

- Freddie Mac **does not charge extra fees** solely because a Mortgage is **pledged** under a Warehouse Agreement.  
- The only fees applicable are those tied to specific **Mortgage programs** (as described elsewhere in the Guide, e.g., credit fees, buydown fees, or settlement interest).

✅ **Result:** Sellers are not charged separate "Pledged Mortgage" delivery fees.

---

## (b) Seller’s Reimbursement Obligation

The Seller **must reimburse Freddie Mac** for any **reasonable expenses** that Freddie Mac incurs due to:
- The **delivery of Pledged Mortgages** by Warehouse Lenders to Freddie Mac; or  
- Any **ancillary handling, documentation, or verification processes** associated with those deliveries.

---

## (c) Notice and Payment Terms

1. Freddie Mac will issue a **written notice** to the Seller specifying:  
   - The **nature** of the expenses incurred, and  
   - The **exact dollar amount** to be reimbursed.

2. The Seller must **reimburse Freddie Mac within 10 Business Days** of receiving Freddie Mac’s written request.

3. Payment must be made in accordance with Freddie Mac’s standard **ACH procedures** for Seller reimbursements (see Section 6303.2(a)).
