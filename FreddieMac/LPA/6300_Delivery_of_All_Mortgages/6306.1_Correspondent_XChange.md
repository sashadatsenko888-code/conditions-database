## Overview

This section outlines the **requirements, processes, and obligations** for Sellers participating in **Correspondent XChange®**, which is a part of Freddie Mac’s **Servicing-Released XChange®** suite.  
The Correspondent XChange platform enables the **sale and transfer of Freddie Mac-eligible Mortgages** originated by third parties (Originators) through **approved aggregators**, providing liquidity and simplified **servicing transfer capabilities**.

---

## (a) Seller Participation Requirements for Correspondent XChange®

### Eligibility and Approval
- Sellers must **apply for approval** from Freddie Mac to participate as **Originators** under Correspondent XChange®.  
- Approval is granted pursuant to the terms of **Exhibit 29 – Correspondent XChange® Operational Bifurcation Multi-Party Agreement**.  
- To apply, Sellers must contact:
  - Their **Freddie Mac representative**, or  
  - **Customer Service at 800-FREDDIE**.  

### Access Provision  
Once approved, Freddie Mac grants the Originator **appropriate system access** to execute and manage Correspondent XChange transactions through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

✅ **Purpose:** Enables Sellers to originate loans and sell them to aggregators under Freddie Mac-compliant terms.

---

## (b) Transfer of Data to Aggregators for Operational Bifurcated Mortgages

### Data Transfer Workflow
- Under **Correspondent XChange**, **Originators** (approved Sellers) use the **Third Party Transaction Services** functionality in **Loan Selling Advisor®** to transfer loan data to **approved aggregators**.
- These aggregators are Freddie Mac–approved **Sellers** authorized to deliver **Operational Bifurcated Mortgages** directly to Freddie Mac.

### Key Definitions
- **Originator:** Freddie Mac–approved Seller who originates the loan and transfers it via Correspondent XChange.
- **Aggregator:** Freddie Mac–approved Seller purchasing the Originator’s loans and selling them to Freddie Mac for cash.

✅ **Result:** The data flow and loan transfer occur securely within Freddie Mac’s controlled environment.

---

## (c) Agreement and Obligations Under Correspondent XChange®

### Multi-Party Agreement (Exhibit 29)
For each **Operational Bifurcated Mortgage** sold by the Originator to the Aggregator and subsequently by the Aggregator to Freddie Mac:
- Both the **Originator** and the **Seller (Aggregator)** are bound by the terms of **Exhibit 29**.
- This document governs **data transfer, representations, and obligations** under the Correspondent XChange execution.

### Allocation of Obligations
Freddie Mac defines the distribution of liability between Originator and Aggregator as follows (referencing **Sections 7101.3(c)–(f)** and **Exhibit 29**):

| Obligation Type | Definition | Primary Responsible Party | Legal Basis |
|------------------|-------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Origination and Sale Obligations** | All representations, warranties, and duties associated with the loan’s origination and sale to Freddie Mac. | **Originator** | Exhibit 29 & 7101.3(c)–(e) |
| **Servicing Obligations** | Responsibilities relating to the ongoing servicing of the loan post-sale. | **Aggregator / Servicer** | Exhibit 29 & 7101.3(f) |

✅ **Key Point:** Freddie Mac enforces a **clear operational and legal separation** between origination duties and servicing duties for bifurcated transactions.

| Step | Party | Requirement | Reference |

- **Operational Efficiency:** Streamlines data sharing and sale processes through a unified digital platform.  
- **Risk Segmentation:** Separates origination risk from servicing risk, clarifying post-sale responsibilities.
