## Overview

This section specifies the **delivery and authorization requirements** for **Pledged Mortgages** allocated to **Guarantor** or **MultiLender Swap Contracts**, including **UMBS®**, **MBS**, and **WAC ARM PC** transactions.  
It outlines responsibilities for completing wire transfer information, executing Form 996E, and ensuring authorized personnel handle all related actions in **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

## (a) Required Actions for Pledged Mortgages under Guarantor or MultiLender Swap Contracts

When delivering **Pledged Mortgages** under a Guarantor or MultiLender Swap Contract, the **Seller** must complete the following:

### 1. Wire Transfer Information
- Enter **all required wire transfer details** and payment instructions in the appropriate **Loan Selling Advisor®** screens.
- These instructions must be approved by the Seller’s authorized **Setup Manager**.

---

### 2. Form 996E – Warehouse Provider Release and Transfer
- The **Warehouse Lender** must submit **Form 996E** to **Freddie Mac** in accordance with procedures in **Section 6305.8**.
- This form authorizes Freddie Mac to release or transfer the Warehouse Lender’s security interest in the pledged loans.

---

## (b) Authorized Roles and Employee Validation

### Setup Manager (Seller)
- The **employee performing the Setup Manager role** (who approves wire transfer information in Loan Selling Advisor®) **must be listed as an “Authorized Employee”** on the Seller’s **Certificate(s) of Incumbency**.
- Reference: **Section 2201.1** and **Section 2403.11** for details on designating and validating Authorized Employees.
- **If the Setup Manager is not authorized**, Freddie Mac **may postpone the Settlement Date.**

---

### Warehouse Lender Representative
- The person who **submits Form 996E** must be listed as **authorized on Form 990SF**, *Warehouse Provider Certificate of Incumbency*.
- The individual must have authority to:
  - Provide Freddie Mac with transfer instructions, or
  - Modify existing transfer instructions on behalf of the Warehouse Lender.

- If:
  - The individual is **not listed as an Authorized Employee**, or  
  - **Form 990SF** is not received in time, or  
  - Freddie Mac determines that the **Certificate of Incumbency information is unreliable**,  
  Then Freddie Mac **may, at its sole discretion, postpone the Settlement Date.**
