## Overview

This section describes the **delivery procedures** for **Pledged Mortgages** sold to Freddie Mac under a **Purchase Contract**, focusing on the required documentation and Freddie Mac’s discretionary authority to require an additional **Quad Party Agreement**.

---

## (a) Required Form: **Form 996E – Warehouse Provider Release and Transfer**

Form 996E is the **core delivery document** for Pledged Mortgages sold to Freddie Mac.  
It serves as the official authorization for the **Warehouse Lender to release its interest** in the pledged loans and transfer them for purchase.

### Contents of Form 996E:
Each submission must include an **Appendix I** listing every Mortgage in the delivery batch, containing the following loan-level details:

| Field | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Freddie Mac Contract Number** | Identifier for the applicable Purchase Contract. |
| **Freddie Mac Loan Number** | The assigned Freddie Mac loan identifier for each Mortgage. |
| **UPB (Unpaid Principal Balance)** | Current outstanding loan balance at the time of delivery. |
| **Borrower’s Name** | Name of the Borrower on the Note. |
| **Mortgaged Premises Address** | Full property address securing the Mortgage. |

---

## (b) Optional Additional Agreement – **Quad Party Agreement**

- Freddie Mac may, **at its sole discretion**, require an additional **addendum** to the Form 996E, commonly known as the **Quad Party Agreement**.  
- This addendum may be required **in specific delivery or risk scenarios**, and may include:

  - The **Seller**,  
  - The **Warehouse Lender**,  
  - The **Document Custodian**, and  
  - **Freddie Mac** itself.  

- The purpose of this addendum is to **formalize coordination and custody obligations** among all four parties for Pledged Mortgage deliveries.

|--------------|------------------|----------|--------------------------|
