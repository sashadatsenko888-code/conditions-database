## Overview

This section establishes that **Freddie Mac assumes no liability** for any financial or operational losses that may occur if the **Settlement Date** for a **Pledged Mortgage** is **postponed** due to the **Seller’s noncompliance** with authorization or delivery requirements.

## (a) General Rule — No Freddie Mac Liability

Freddie Mac will **not be liable** to any of the following parties for **losses, costs, expenses, or damages** resulting from a **postponed Settlement Date**:
- The **Seller**,  
- The **Warehouse Lender**, or  
- **Any third party** involved in the transaction.  

---

## (b) Triggers for Postponement

A Settlement Date may be **postponed** if the Seller fails to properly deliver or authorize **required documentation or instructions**, including:

### (i) **Form 987E** – Wire Transfer Authorization for a Cash Warehouse Delivery
- The Seller must correctly deliver this form through the **Loan Selling Advisor®** system.  
- Postponement occurs if:
  - The form is **missing**, **incomplete**, or **not uploaded** into the applicable Loan Selling Advisor® screen, or  
  - The **person executing Form 987E** is **not an Authorized Employee**.

---

### (ii) **Form 996E** – Warehouse Provider Release and Transfer
- The Seller must ensure that the contact person listed on this form is an **Authorized Employee**.
- Postponement occurs if:
  - The form is **missing**, **not submitted in time**, or  
  - The **listed contact person** is **not authorized**.

---

### (iii) **Loan Selling Advisor Setup Manager Role**
- The employee performing the **Setup Manager role** (approving wire transfer information and settlement instructions) must be an **Authorized Employee** on the Seller’s **Certificate of Incumbency**.  
- If this individual is not properly designated, Freddie Mac may **postpone the Settlement Date** until compliance is confirmed.
