Section: 6305.6 – Acceptance for Purchase or Rejection of Pledged Mortgages  
Effective Date: 10/02/2019  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview

This section outlines **Freddie Mac’s procedures** when reviewing **Pledged Mortgages** for purchase.  
It defines the process for **acceptance or rejection** and establishes the **return protocol** for Notes associated with **rejected Pledged Mortgages**.

---

## (a) Acceptance or Rejection Decision

- After receiving the delivery of a **Pledged Mortgage**, Freddie Mac will review the submission to determine whether it **meets all eligibility and documentation requirements**.
- If Freddie Mac **decides not to purchase** a particular Pledged Mortgage:
  - Freddie Mac will **notify the Seller** of the decision, and  
  - The **Note** for that Mortgage will be **returned to the Warehouse Lender** identified in the applicable **Form 996E, Warehouse Provider Release and Transfer**.

---

## (b) Delivery of Returned Note

If a Pledged Mortgage is **rejected for purchase**, Freddie Mac will direct that:

- The **original Note** be delivered either to:
  1. The **Warehouse Lender** listed on the Form 996E, or  
  2. That Warehouse Lender’s **document custodian**, if applicable.

This ensures that the lender retaining the security interest or collateral control over the loan regains possession of the Note promptly and securely.

## (c) Summary Table

| Event | Freddie Mac Action | Recipient | Reference Form |
|--------|--------------------|------------|----------------|
| Pledged Mortgage accepted | Freddie Mac purchases loan | N/A | N/A |
| Pledged Mortgage rejected | Freddie Mac notifies Seller | Note returned to Warehouse Lender or its Document Custodian | **Form 996E** |
