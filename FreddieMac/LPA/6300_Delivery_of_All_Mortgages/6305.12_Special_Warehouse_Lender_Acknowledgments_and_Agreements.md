## Overview

This section defines the **documentation, authorization, renewal, and indemnification requirements** for **Warehouse Lenders** participating in the delivery of **Pledged Mortgages** to Freddie Mac.  

Warehouse Lenders must execute and maintain specific Freddie Mac forms (primarily **Form 990SF** and **Form 996E**) to authorize employees, approve transfers, and maintain system access via **Loan Selling Advisor®**.  

---

## (a) Form 990SF – Agreement and Certificate of Incumbency: Warehouse Lender

### (i) Purpose  
Each Warehouse Lender must execute **Form 990SF**, including **Exhibit A (Board Resolution)**, to:  
- Identify and authorize specific employees (by **title** or **name and title**) who can provide Freddie Mac with **instructions or modifications** related to pledged loan sales through Loan Selling Advisor®.  
- Authorize designated **Administrators** to assign access roles:  
  - **External WHL Approver**, and  
  - **External WHL Reviewer**.

### (ii) Conditions for Access  
- Freddie Mac will **not grant Loan Selling Advisor access** to a new Warehouse Lender until its **Form 990SF** is **completed, signed, and accepted**.  
- Any person performing **Approver** or **Reviewer** roles must be listed on the form as an **Authorized Employee**.

### (iii) Signature and Electronic Delivery Standards  
- The Certificate must include:
  - Either a **pen and ink signature** or an **Electronic copy/representation** of the original signature of each Authorized Employee.  
- The form, **Resolution**, and any supporting documentation must be delivered:
  - **As an Electronic Record (PDF)** containing an **Electronic Signature**, per **Section 1401.2**.
  - Signed by the Warehouse Lender’s **Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or legal counsel**.

✅ Freddie Mac may verify or authenticate submissions but its failure to do so **does not constitute negligence**.

---

### (iv) Legal Representation and Renewal Requirements

By executing and submitting **Form 990SF**, the Warehouse Lender makes **the same representations, warranties, and covenants** to Freddie Mac as Sellers make under **Section 2201.1**.

Freddie Mac may periodically require resubmission or update of the form. Renewal timelines are as follows:

| Document | Renewal Frequency | Freddie Mac Notice | Requirement |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| **Form 990SF** | Every **2 years** | ~120 days before due date | Must submit renewed Certificate |
| **Board Resolution (Exhibit A)** | Every **4 years** | ~120 days before due date | Must submit renewed Resolution |

If a Warehouse Lender fails to deliver a renewal Certificate on time:  
- Freddie Mac may **cancel or postpone** purchases of **Pledged Mortgages** financed by that Warehouse Lender until compliance is met.  
- The Warehouse Lender must **indemnify Freddie Mac** (including directors, officers, employees, successors, assigns, and transfer agents) against **all consequences of such cancellation or postponement**.

---

## (b) Form 475 — Deleted
- **Form 475** has been merged into **Form 990SF** since October 31, 2018.  
- No longer required or accepted.

---

## (c) Form 996E – Warehouse Provider Release and Transfer

- For every Freddie Mac purchase of **Pledged Mortgages**, the **Warehouse Lender** must submit **Form 996E** through **Loan Selling Advisor®**.  
- Freddie Mac will **not accept “bailee letters”** or equivalent documentation as substitutes.  

If a Warehouse Lender or any other party submits a **bailee letter or equivalent**, Freddie Mac reserves the right to:
- **Cancel** or  
- **Postpone** the **Settlement Date** for the related Pledged Mortgage(s), at its sole discretion.

---

## (d) Summary Table

| Requirement | Form | Responsible Party | Frequency | Freddie Mac Action if Missing |
|--------------|------|-------------------|------------|-------------------------------|
| Authorized Employee Designation | **Form 990SF + Exhibit A** | Warehouse Lender | Initial + Every 2 years | Access withheld or suspended |
| Board Resolution | **Exhibit A (attached to 990SF)** | Warehouse Lender | Every 4 years | Purchase postponement |
| Pledged Loan Release | **Form 996E** | Warehouse Lender | Each transaction | Settlement postponed |
| Disallowed Documentation | “Bailee letters” | Warehouse Lender | N/A | Settlement canceled |
