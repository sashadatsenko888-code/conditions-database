### 2. **Endorsement Verification**
- Each Note must be **endorsed per Section 6301.3**.  
- If the delivering Seller/Servicer is **not the original payee**, the Custodian must confirm a **complete, continuous chain of endorsements** from the **original payee** to the **Seller** delivering the Note to Freddie Mac (not to the Servicer).

---

### 3. **Assignment Verification**
- All assignments of the **Security Instrument** from the **original Mortgagee** to the **Seller/Servicer** or **MERS®** must be:
  - Properly **prepared, executed, and recorded** where required, and  
  - In compliance with **Sections 6301.6** and **7101.4(a)**.  
- The Seller/Servicer must provide documentation allowing the Custodian to confirm whether the Seller elected to **retain physical custody of assignments** for **MERS-registered Mortgages** under **Section 6301.6**.

| **Security Agreement** | Original |
| **Recognition Agreement** | Original |

---

## (b) Certification

- The Document Custodian must **certify** each Mortgage according to applicable **Purchase Documents**.  
- **Do not execute Custodian Certification** if:
  - Any Note data does **not match** Loan Selling Advisor® records, or  
  - Any discrepancy is **not adequately justified**.  
- The Custodian must **notify the Seller/Servicer immediately** of any:
  - Errors,  
  - Omissions, or  
  - Discrepancies requiring correction before certification.

---

## (c) Electronically Recorded Documents

Refer to:
- **Section 1401.14** — For **electronically recorded paper documents**.  
- **Section 1401.15** — For **electronically recorded electronic documents** (as defined in §1401.2).

These govern how hybrid or fully digital records are to be received, validated, and certified.
