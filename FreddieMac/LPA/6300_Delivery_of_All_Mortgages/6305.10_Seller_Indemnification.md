## Overview

This section defines the **Seller’s indemnification obligations** to **Freddie Mac** for any **losses, claims, or liabilities** that arise from **errors, omissions, or failures** related to Pledged Mortgages and related warehouse financing processes.  

The Seller must **indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Freddie Mac**, its **successors, assigns, and transfer agents**, from **all losses, damages, and legal costs** resulting from the Seller’s or its Warehouse Lender’s actions, inactions, or misrepresentations.

---

## (a) Scope of Indemnification

The Seller agrees to indemnify Freddie Mac against **any and all losses, claims, demands, actions, suits, damages, costs, or expenses** (including **reasonable attorney fees**) that arise or are incurred due to **any** of the following six conditions:

---

### (1) Custody of Notes and Documents  
> **Cause:**  
Loss or issue arising from the **deposit or custody** of the Note and any ancillary documents held by the Document Custodian.

> **Includes:**  
- Maintenance of such documents **pending Freddie Mac’s purchase** of the Mortgage.  
- The **return of rejected Notes** and related documents when Freddie Mac determines **not to purchase** certain Mortgages.  

✅ **Responsibility:** Seller bears all risk while Notes are held in custodial status.

---

### (2) Delivery of Purchase Proceeds  
> **Cause:**  
Losses related to Freddie Mac’s **delivery or transfer of Purchase Proceeds** to any person.

> **Freddie Mac is protected if:**  
- UMBS®, MBS, or WAC ARM PC proceeds were **delivered per the Purchase Documents and Loan Selling Advisor® instructions**, or  
- Cash proceeds were **delivered per the Seller’s Form 987E** (Wire Transfer Authorization for Warehouse Delivery).  

✅ **Responsibility:** Seller must ensure all wire instructions are valid, current, and authorized.

---

### (3) Failure to Provide Authorized Certificate of Incumbency  
> **Cause:**  
Seller’s failure to deliver the proper **Certificate of Incumbency** designating Authorized Employees.  

> **Forms covered:**  
- **Form 988SF** – For banks, corporations, or LLCs  
- **Form 988SF–HFA** – For Housing Finance Agencies  
- **Form 989SF** – For limited partnerships  

✅ **Responsibility:** Seller must ensure all Authorized Employees are valid and properly designated to issue or modify wire or transfer instructions.

---

### (4) Incorrect or Unauthorized Wire Instructions  
> **Cause:**  
Seller’s failure to provide **complete, accurate, and authorized** wire transfer instructions, or failure to **notify Freddie Mac** of any changes to such instructions.  

✅ **Responsibility:** Maintain and update wire data promptly to avoid liability for misdirected or fraudulent transfers.

---

### (5) Unreleased Third-Party Security Interests  
> **Cause:**  
Presence or failure to release any **third-party security interests, claims, or encumbrances**, including from the **Warehouse Lender**.  

✅ **Responsibility:** Seller must ensure all **third-party interests are fully released** and **title is clear** prior to Settlement.

---

### (6) Failure of Warehouse Lender to Submit Required Forms  
> **Cause:**  
Warehouse Lender fails to submit required documents, such as:  
- **Form 990SF** – Agreement and Certificate of Incumbency: Warehouse Lender  
- **Form 996E** – Warehouse Provider Release and Transfer  

✅ **Responsibility:** Seller must ensure Warehouse Lender completes and submits all forms **per Section 6305.12** before Settlement.
