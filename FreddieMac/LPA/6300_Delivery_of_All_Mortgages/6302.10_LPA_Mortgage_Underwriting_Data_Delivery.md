## Overview
This section outlines the ULDD data delivery requirements for **Loan Product Advisor® (LPA)** and **Loan Prospector®** Mortgages.  
It also includes special delivery requirements for **ACE (Automated Collateral Evaluation)** and **ACE+ PDR (Property Data Report)** loans.

## (a) General Requirements

A Mortgage delivered **without** a Key Number will be treated as a **Non-Loan Product Advisor Mortgage**.
