## Key Logic

| Renovation completed before settlement | CHOICERenovation | Deliver total cost and completed project data. |
| Renovation still in progress at settlement | CHOICERenovation In Progress | Deliver total expected cost and modification tracking. |
| Express loan (not in Duty to Serve area) | CHOICEReno EXpress | Identify as streamlined renovation. |
| Express loan (Duty to Serve area) | CHOICEReno EXpress DTS Area | Identify as DTS-eligible streamlined renovation. |
| Includes energy-efficient improvements | Add Energy Improvement Amount (244.1) per §6302.23 | Include energy portion within total Alterations/Repairs cost. |
