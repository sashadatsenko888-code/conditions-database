Section: 6302.45 – Special Delivery Requirements for Cooperative Share Loans  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section establishes **data delivery and pooling requirements** for **Cooperative Share Loans**, which are loans secured by a **borrower’s ownership interest (shares) in a cooperative housing corporation** rather than by direct ownership of real property.  
These requirements ensure Freddie Mac can correctly classify and pool Cooperative Share Loans for Cash or Guarantor delivery.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- Refer to **Chapter 5705** for eligibility and underwriting requirements for Cooperative Share Loans.  
- Sellers must ensure project classification and documentation meet Freddie Mac’s standards before delivery.  
- “Exempt From Review” status applies only to specific Freddie Mac-owned refinance types (see §5705.7).

## (b) Data Delivery Instructions

### (i) All Cooperative Share Loans
All Cooperative Share Loans must include the following ULDD Data Points:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **PROPERTY → Property Details** | | | |
| 57 | **Financed Unit Count** | `1` | Only one cooperative unit is financed per loan. |
| 47 | **Project Legal Structure Type** | `Cooperative` | Identifies the project as a Cooperative Housing Corporation. |
| 641.5 / 641.6 | **Taxpayer Identifier Type / Taxpayer Identifier Value** | *EIN or TIN* | Enter the Employer Identification Number (EIN) or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the Cooperative Housing Corporation (or the HOA if within a master/umbrella structure). |
| 42 | **Project Classification Identifier** | `Exempt From Review` or `Full Review` | Use “Exempt From Review” for Freddie Mac-owned “no cash-out” refinances or Refi Possible® Mortgages (§5705.7). Use “Full Review” for all others. |

---

### (ii) Cooperative Share Loans **Not Delivered as “Exempt From Review”**
When a Cooperative Share Loan requires **Full Review**, deliver the following additional ULDD Data Points:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **PROPERTY → Condominium Details** | | | |
| 48 | **Project Name** | *(Text)* | Enter the project’s **legal name**. |
| 41 | **Project Attachment Type** | `Attached` / `Detached` | “Attached” if any unit shares a common wall or structure; “Detached” only if none do. |
| 45 | **Project Dwelling Unit Count** | *(Numeric)* | Total number of units in the project, including incomplete phases. |
| 46 | **Project Dwelling Units Sold Count** | *(Numeric)* | Total number of sold units, including incomplete phases. |

---

## (c) Delivery Requirements for Fixed-Rate Cash Contracts
To maintain liquidity and delivery balance:
- The total **Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB)** of Cooperative Share Loans sold under fixed-rate Cash Contracts in any month **must not exceed**:
  - $2 million in aggregate; **or**
  - **10% of total UPB** of each fixed-rate Mortgage product (10-, 15-, 20-, or 30-year),  
  whichever is greater.

---

## (d) Pooling Requirements for UMBS® and MBS
Refer to **Section 6202.3** for pooling requirements governing fixed-rate Cooperative Share Loans sold under:
- **Fixed-rate Guarantor** or  
- **MultiLender Swap** programs.

## Key Logic
| Scenario | ULDD Field(s) | Required Value(s) | Description |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Any Cooperative Share Loan | 47 | Cooperative | Identifies project type. |
| Exempt From Review | 42 | Exempt From Review | For Freddie Mac-owned refinances or Refi Possible®. |
| Full Review | 42 = Full Review, plus 48, 41, 45, 46 | Requires full project-level reporting. |
| Master/umbrella association | 641.5 / 641.6 | Use HOA’s EIN/TIN (not master’s). |
| Single financed unit | 57 | 1 | Must always be one unit financed per loan. |

## Checklist
- [ ] Confirm **Project Legal Structure Type = Cooperative**.  
- [ ] Deliver **Taxpayer Identifier Type/Value (EIN or TIN)** for the cooperative corporation.  
- [ ] Determine if project qualifies as **Exempt From Review** (§5705.7).  
- [ ] If **Full Review**, include project name, unit counts, and attachment type.  
- [ ] Ensure monthly fixed-rate Cash deliveries comply with the **$2M / 10% UPB limit**.  
- [ ] Reference §6202.3 for applicable pooling program.
