## Overview
This section defines **data delivery and documentation requirements** for **First-Generation Homebuyer Mortgages**.  
The purpose of these delivery requirements is to allow Freddie Mac to identify and track loans made to first-generation homebuyers — borrowers who meet the definition provided in the **Freddie Mac Glossary**.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- Refer to the **Glossary** for the definition of a **First-Generation Homebuyer Mortgage**.  
  Generally, this applies to borrowers whose parents **never owned a home**, or who **previously lived in rental or non-ownership housing** and are **purchasing their first home**.  
- The Seller must retain **Form 1109, First-Generation Homebuyer Certification**, **signed and completed by all Borrowers**.  
  This document must be kept in the **Mortgage file** for Freddie Mac’s review or post-purchase quality control.

---

## (b) Data Delivery Instructions
For all **First-Generation Homebuyer Mortgages**, the Seller must deliver the following ULDD Data Point:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **LOAN – Current → Product Details** | 368 | **Investor Feature Identifier = K09** | Indicates the Mortgage is classified as a **First-Generation Homebuyer Mortgage** under Freddie Mac requirements. |

---

## Key Logic
| Scenario | Field | Value | Description |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Loan meets Freddie Mac definition of a First-Generation Homebuyer | 368 – Investor Feature Identifier | **K09** | Identifies the Mortgage as a First-Generation Homebuyer Mortgage. |
| Loan does not meet definition | — | *No entry required* | Do not deliver K09 unless the borrower qualifies and Form 1109 is completed. |

---

## Checklist
- [ ] Confirm Borrower(s) qualify as **First-Generation Homebuyers** (per Glossary).  
- [ ] Obtain and retain **Form 1109 – First-Generation Homebuyer Certification** signed by all Borrowers.  
- [ ] Deliver **Investor Feature Identifier = K09** in ULDD data.  
- [ ] Do **not** deliver K09 for non-qualifying Borrowers.
