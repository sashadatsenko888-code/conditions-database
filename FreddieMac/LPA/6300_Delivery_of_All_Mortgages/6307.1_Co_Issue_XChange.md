Section: 6307.1 – Co-Issue XChange®  
Effective Date: 09/10/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview

**Co-Issue XChange®** is one of the executions under **Servicing-Released XChange®**, Freddie Mac’s framework for transferring **Servicing Contract Rights (SCRs)** at the same time a Mortgage is sold.  
This section defines the **approval, pricing, funding, and reconciliation requirements** for Sellers who sell Mortgages to Freddie Mac through Co-Issue XChange and concurrently transfer servicing to a Freddie Mac-approved Servicer.

---

## (a) Seller Participation Requirements for Co-Issue XChange®

### Approval Process
To participate as a Seller under **Co-Issue XChange**, an institution must:
- Apply to Freddie Mac for approval pursuant to **Exhibit 26**,  
  *Agreement for Concurrent Transfer of Single-Family Mortgage Servicing Contract Rights With Complete/Full Bifurcation*.
- Contact:
  - Their **Freddie Mac representative**, or  
  - **Customer Service at 800-FREDDIE**, for application guidance.

Once approved, Freddie Mac will grant the Seller **access to the Co-Issue XChange execution option** in **Loan Selling Advisor®**.

✅ **Result:** Enables Sellers to sell loans and simultaneously transfer servicing to a Freddie Mac-approved Servicer.

---

## (b) Other Related Guide Provisions

For additional servicing transfer guidance and compliance context, Sellers must refer to:
- **Section 7101.1(b)** – General Servicing Transfer Eligibility and Execution Standards  
- **Sections 7101.3(c) through (f)** – Requirements defining and allocating:
  - Origination and Sale Obligations  
  - Servicing Obligations  

These cross-references govern how Freddie Mac allocates liability between the Seller and the Servicer during and after the transfer.

---

## (c) Co-Issue XChange Cash Pricing

### Process Overview
Freddie Mac’s **Co-Issue All-in Price Process** allows Sellers to:
1. Obtain a **consolidated price** (covering both loan sale and servicing rights).  
2. Simultaneously **sell the Mortgage** to Freddie Mac.  
3. **Transfer the Servicing Contract Rights** to a participating Servicer.

The “All-in” price includes:
- The **purchase price** of the Mortgage from Freddie Mac, and  
- The **Servicing-rights price** offered by the Servicer.

### Eligibility
- Sellers can use the Co-Issue All-in Price Process **only if** the Servicer has elected to participate with Freddie Mac for Co-Issue transactions with that Seller.  
- Prices and fees under **Mandatory Cash** or **Best Efforts Contracts** are **not final at commitment**, but finalized **on the Funding Date**, based on the Mortgage data delivered.

### Seller Data Requirements
The Seller must deliver **all required Mortgage data** in Loan Selling Advisor, specifically:
- **Loan Fields Required for Pricing**
- **Additional Loan Fields That Affect Pricing**

Freddie Mac uses this data to allow the Servicer to generate an **accurate bid** for the Servicing-rights assumption.

✅ **Key Responsibility:** The Seller’s data accuracy directly determines Servicer pricing integrity.

## (d) Funding Adjustments and Net Funding

### Components of Funding Adjustments
Funding adjustments include:
- **Escrow funds**  
- **Interest adjustment**  
- **Servicing Spread**  
- **Tax service fee**  
- **Transaction fee**  
- **Temporary subsidy buydown funds**

### Funding Process on the Funding Date
1. **Seller Actions:**
   - Enter Escrow and temporary buydown fund amounts in Loan Selling Advisor for each Mortgage.  
   - These fields are **not validated or edited** by Freddie Mac.

2. **Freddie Mac Actions:**
   - Calculates the **interest adjustment**, **Servicing Spread**, **tax service**, and **transaction fees** automatically.
   - **Deducts** the total funding adjustments from the Seller’s sales proceeds.
   - **Forwards** the deducted amounts to the Servicer.

### Reconciliation & Responsibility
- **Seller and Servicer** must handle **any discrepancies** or **corrections** related to Escrow or buydown amounts.  
- Freddie Mac will **not adjust or refund** Escrow or temporary buydown funds **after the Funding Date**.

### Quality Control Disclosure
Freddie Mac may share the following with the **Transferee Servicer**:
- Quality control findings,  
- Seller responses to those findings, and  
- Defect reports related to Mortgages sold through Co-Issue XChange.

✅ **Purpose:** Ensures transparency and Servicer readiness for post-sale quality management.
