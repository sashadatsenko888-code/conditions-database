## Overview
This section establishes **data delivery**, **program**, and **pooling requirements** for **super conforming Mortgages**, which are loans exceeding baseline conforming limits but still eligible under Freddie Mac’s high-cost area provisions.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- See **Chapter 4603** for eligibility requirements for super conforming Mortgages.  
- See **Exhibit 17S – Available Mortgage Products** for applicable product eligibility and term options.  
- Super conforming Mortgages must comply with all Freddie Mac underwriting, pricing, and delivery rules specific to this category.

## (b) Data Delivery Instructions

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **PROPERTY → Appraisal / Property Valuation Details** ||||
| 89/90 | Property Valuation Method Type / Other Description | Desktop Appraisal<br>Full Appraisal<br>Other – Desk Review<br>Other – Field Review | “Desktop Appraisal” – if desktop valuation used.<br>“Full Appraisal” – if interior/exterior inspection used.<br>“Other – Desk Review” – if valuation completed via desk review.<br>“Other – Field Review” – if field review conducted. |
| 82 | Appraisal Identifier | — | Enter document file ID of the appraisal. Field reviews are not submitted to UCDP. |

---

## (c) Delivery Programs
- Sellers permitted to deliver **fixed-rate super conforming Mortgages** under the **Guarantor program** may also deliver such loans under **fixed-rate Cash Contracts**, unless restricted by negotiated terms.  
- Delivery under other programs (e.g., ARM or nonstandard executions) is subject to Freddie Mac approval.

---

## (d) Delivery Requirements for Fixed-Rate Cash Contracts
- For Sellers delivering fixed-rate **super conforming Mortgages** under **Cash Contracts**:

| Seller Delivery Volume | Maximum Aggregate Super Conforming UPB (per month) |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Total Cash Deliveries ≤ $20 million | $2 million |
| Total Cash Deliveries > $20 million | ≤ 10% of UPB per product type (10-, 15-, 20-, or 30-year fixed) |

**Exceptions (excluded from the cap):**
1. **Freddie Mac Enhanced Relief Refinance® Mortgages** with **LTV > 105%**, delivered under fixed-rate Cash Contracts.  
2. **Mortgages receiving cash-specified payups** per Section 6101.3(d).  

---

## (e) Pooling Requirements for UMBS® and MBS
- Refer to **Section 6202.3** for **pooling rules** applicable to **fixed-rate super conforming Mortgages** under:
  - Fixed-rate **Guarantor**, and  
  - **MultiLender Swap** programs.

---

## Key Logic
| Scenario | Required ULDD Entry | Description |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| Super conforming Mortgage | Property Valuation Method Type = one of allowed values | Identifies appraisal methodology used. |
| Super conforming Mortgage delivered under Cash Contract | Subject to UPB limits | Must meet program delivery caps. |

---

- [ ] Deliver valid **Property Valuation Method Type (Sort ID 89/90)**.  
- [ ] Include **Appraisal Identifier (Sort ID 82)**.  
- [ ] Ensure **UPB aggregate limits** are not exceeded under Cash program.
