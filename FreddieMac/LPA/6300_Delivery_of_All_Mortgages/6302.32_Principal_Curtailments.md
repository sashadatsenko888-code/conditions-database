Section: 6302.32 – Special Delivery Requirements for Mortgages with Principal Curtailments  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section outlines **data delivery requirements** for **Mortgages with principal curtailments** (partial prepayments applied to reduce unpaid principal balance (UPB)) that occur **before sale to Freddie Mac**, provided such curtailments **do not trigger a payment recalculation (recast).**

---

## (a) General Requirements
- Applies when a Borrower or third party makes a **principal curtailment** prior to Freddie Mac delivery.  
- **Recast not performed:**  
  - If the curtailment does **not** result in recalculating the Borrower’s monthly payment, follow this section.  
- **Recast performed:**  
  - If monthly payments are recalculated, the Mortgage must be delivered as a **Seller-Owned Modified Mortgage** under **Section 6302.27.**

## (b) Data Delivery Instructions

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **LOAN – Closing → Note Details** ||||
| 256 | Loan Maturity Date | — | Enter the **original Note maturity date**, disregarding any change due to principal curtailment. |
| **LOAN – Current → Payment Details** ||||
| 438 | Aggregate Loan Curtailment Amount | — | Enter the **total dollar amount** of all principal curtailments received as of the **Funding Date**. |

---

## Key Logic
| Scenario | Required ULDD Entry | Description |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| Principal curtailment received (no recast) | Sort ID 438 = total curtailment | Reflects all pre-funding curtailments. |
| Mortgage not modified | Sort ID 256 = original maturity date | Original loan term remains unchanged. |
| Mortgage recast after curtailment | N/A (use Section 6302.27) | Treated as Seller-Owned Modified Mortgage. |

---

## Checklist
- [ ] Confirm curtailment applied before Freddie Mac delivery.  
- [ ] Verify monthly payment **not recalculated** (no modification).  
- [ ] Report **Loan Maturity Date (256)** unchanged.  
- [ ] Report **Aggregate Loan Curtailment Amount (438)** as of Funding Date.  
- [ ] If payment was recalculated → deliver under Section 6302.27 instead.
