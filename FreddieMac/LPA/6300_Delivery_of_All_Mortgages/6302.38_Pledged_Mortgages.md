## Overview
This section defines **data delivery requirements** for **Pledged Mortgages**, i.e., loans that were subject to a **warehouse financing arrangement** at the time of delivery to Freddie Mac.  
The purpose is to ensure that Freddie Mac receives the **Warehouse Lender’s identifying information** to properly recognize and release warehouse interests in accordance with **Form 996E – Warehouse Provider Release and Transfer**.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- Refer to **Chapter 6305** for **eligibility criteria** and procedural requirements for **Pledged Mortgages**.  
- These Mortgages are typically funded or held by a **Warehouse Lender** before being sold to Freddie Mac.  
- The Seller must ensure the **Warehouse Lender release documentation** (Form 996E) matches the data submitted in Loan Selling Advisor® (LSA).
