## Overview
This section defines **delivery data requirements** for **Mortgages sold to Freddie Mac under the Loan-Level Buyup and Buydown Program**, which adjusts the **Credit Fee in Yield (CFIY)** at the individual loan level.  

- The program allows Sellers to increase or decrease the **price or yield** associated with a Mortgage relative to Freddie Mac’s standard guarantee fee.  
- Governed by **Section 6201.10** of the Guide.

## (a) General Requirements
- Refer to **Section 6201.10** for full program parameters.  
- Loan-level buyups and buydowns represent a negotiated adjustment to the **Credit Fee in Yield** applicable to a Guarantor or MultiLender Swap Contract.  
- The adjustment is measured in **basis points (bps)**.  
- The program is **not applicable** for Cash program sales.

## Key Logic
| Scenario | Required ULDD Entry | Description |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| Loan sold under Guarantor or MultiLender Swap with Credit Fee adjustment | 387 = “Buyup” or “Buydown” | Indicates the loan participates in the buyup/buydown program. |
| No loan-level price adjustment | 387 = “BuyupBuydownDoesNotApply” | Standard loan with no CFIY adjustment. |
| Adjustment applied | 386 = numeric value in basis points | Reflects increase or decrease in guarantee fee yield. |

---
