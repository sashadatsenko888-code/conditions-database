## Overview

Freddie Mac has **suspended delivery eligibility** for FMERR loans effective **September 1, 2021**, until further notice.

---

## Program Status
- **FMERR Mortgages** with **Application Received Dates on or after July 1, 2021**  
  and  
  **Settlement Dates after August 31, 2021**  
  ➜ **Are not eligible for delivery** to Freddie Mac.  

- The suspension remains in effect **until further notice** from Freddie Mac.  

---

## Impact
- Sellers **must not deliver** any FMERR Mortgages that meet the ineligible date criteria.  
- Any existing pipeline loans should have been delivered **before September 1, 2021**.  
- Freddie Mac continues to accept other refinance products, such as:
  - **Refi Possible®**
  - **Standard “No Cash-Out” Refinance Mortgages**

## Compliance Logic

| Criteria | Eligibility |
|-----------|-------------|
| Application Received Date ≥ 07/01/2021 | ❌ Not eligible |
| Settlement Date > 08/31/2021 | ❌ Not eligible |
| Both conditions met | ❌ Delivery prohibited |
| Prior to these dates | ✅ Eligible (legacy deliveries only, if still active under contract) |

---

## Checklist
- [ ] Verify Application Received Date.  
- [ ] Verify Settlement Date.  
- [ ] If both conditions above apply, **do not deliver** to Freddie Mac.  
- [ ] Consider alternate refinance programs (e.g., Refi Possible®).
