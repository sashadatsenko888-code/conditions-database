Section: 6302.24 – Special Delivery Requirements for Financed Permanent Buydown Mortgages  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section outlines **ULDD data delivery requirements** for **Financed Permanent Buydown Mortgages**, where the **Note Rate is permanently reduced** through **financed discount points**.  

Financed buydowns differ from temporary subsidy buydowns because the **rate reduction applies for the entire loan term**.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- Refer to **Chapter 4601** for eligibility and calculation rules for Financed Permanent Buydown Mortgages.  
- Applies to both **fixed-rate** and **adjustable-rate (ARM)** loans when the buydown is financed into the loan amount.

## (b) Data Delivery Instructions

### (i) All Mortgages with Financed Permanent Buydowns

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **LOAN – Closing → Note Details** ||||
| 321 | Note Rate Percent | — | Enter the **permanently bought down initial Note Rate** (the final interest rate after buydown). |
| 268 | Initial Principal and Interest Payment Amount | — | Enter the **initial P&I payment** calculated at the permanently bought down rate. |
| **→ Additional Underwriting Details** ||||
| 292 | Total Monthly Proposed Housing Expense Amount | — | Calculate using the **initial P&I at the permanently reduced Note Rate**. Round to nearest dollar. |
| **→ Delivered LTV Values** ||||
| 255 | LTV Ratio Percent | — | Compute using **total loan amount including financed discount points**. |
| **TOTAL LOANS → Delivered LTV Values** ||||
| 91 | Combined LTV Ratio Percent | — | Compute using **loan amount that includes financed discount points**. |

---

### (ii) ARMs with Financed Permanent Buydowns

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **LOAN – Closing → ARM Details** ||||
| 114 | Ceiling Rate Percent | — | Calculate using the **permanently bought down initial Note Rate** as the base for determining the lifetime ceiling rate. |

---

## Key Logic
| Loan Type | Note Rate | Payment Basis | LTV Basis | Ceiling Rate (for ARMs) |
|------------|------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Fixed | Permanently bought down | Based on reduced Note Rate | Includes financed points | N/A |
| ARM | Permanently bought down | Based on reduced Note Rate | Includes financed points | Derived from bought down rate |

---

## Checklist
- [ ] Confirm **Note Rate Percent** = permanently reduced rate (not standard rate).  
- [ ] Use **reduced rate** for calculating **P&I** and **monthly housing expense**.  
- [ ] Include **financed discount points** in **LTV** and **CLTV**.  
- [ ] For ARMs: recompute **Ceiling Rate Percent** using the reduced rate.  
- [ ] Ensure all values align with Chapter 4601 eligibility parameters.
