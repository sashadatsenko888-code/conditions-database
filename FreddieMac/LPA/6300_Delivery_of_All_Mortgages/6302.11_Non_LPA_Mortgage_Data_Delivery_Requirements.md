## Overview
This section specifies ULDD delivery data requirements for **Non-Loan Product Advisor (Non-LPA)** Mortgages — i.e., manually underwritten loans not assessed through Loan Product Advisor® or Loan Prospector®.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- **No Key Number** must be delivered for Non-Loan Product Advisor Mortgages.  
- These loans are **manually underwritten**, and Freddie Mac identifies them by the presence of the required **Loan Manual Underwriting Indicator (true)**.

## (b) Data for Non-Loan Product Advisor Mortgages

**ULDD Data Points**

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Values | Notes |
|----------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| **LOAN – Closing → Loan Level Credit Details** ||||
| 328 | Loan Manual Underwriting Indicator | true | Must be `true` for all Non-LPA loans; underwriting decision based on manual review. |
| 251 | Loan Level Credit Score Value | — | Enter if the **Indicator Score** exists (Glossary: *Indicator Score*). |
| 249 | Loan Level Credit Score Selection Method Type | Average Then Average / Middle Or Lower Then Average / Middle Or Lower Then Lowest | Enter if the Indicator Score exists. |
| 247 | Credit Score Impairment Type | Insufficient Credit History / Significant Errors Score | Enter if the Indicator Score does **not** exist or is not usable. |
