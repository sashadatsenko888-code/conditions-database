Section: 6302.37 – Special Delivery Requirements for Mortgages Secured by Properties Subject to Income-Based Resale Restrictions  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section outlines **delivery and ULDD data requirements** for **Mortgages secured by properties subject to income-based resale restrictions** — including those that **survive foreclosure** and those that **terminate upon foreclosure or deed-in-lieu**.  
Such restrictions limit resale price or eligibility to maintain affordability for low- or moderate-income borrowers.  

---

## (a) General Requirements
- See **Chapter 4406** for full eligibility criteria and documentation requirements for **resale-restricted properties**, including those based on income.  
- Restrictions may **survive** or **terminate** following foreclosure, depending on the legal structure of the program.  
- Certain transactions involving **Affordable Seconds® from non-profit sellers** require additional delivery per **Section 6302.34(b)(iv)(C)**.

## (b) Data Delivery Instructions

### (i) Mortgages Secured by Properties Subject to Income-Based Resale Restrictions

---

### (A) Restrictions that **Survive Foreclosure** or Deed-in-Lieu

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **PROPERTY → Affordable Details** ||||
| 90.1 | Deed Restriction Term Months Count | — | Enter duration (in months) of restriction period; enter “0” if unknown. |
| **LOAN – Current → Product Details** ||||
| 404 | Loan Program Identifier | **Income Based Deed Restrictions Survive** | Indicates that resale restrictions remain in force post-foreclosure or deed-in-lieu. |

---

### (B) Restrictions that **Terminate Upon Foreclosure** (or expiration of redemption period)

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **PROPERTY → Affordable Details** ||||
| 90.1 | Deed Restriction Term Months Count | — | Enter restriction duration in months; enter “0” if unknown. |
| **LOAN – Current → Product Details** ||||
| 404 | Loan Program Identifier | **Income Based Deed Restrictions Terminate** | Indicates that restrictions end at foreclosure or deed-in-lieu. |

---

### (C) Mortgages with Affordable Seconds from Non-Profit Sellers (Non-Government Affiliated)
- See **Section 6302.34(b)(iv)(C)** for additional ULDD delivery fields (Investor Feature Identifier = **J07**).  
- These apply when a **non-profit organization** acts as both **property seller and Affordable Second provider** on a property with **income-based resale restrictions**.

---

## Key Logic
| Scenario | Required ULDD Entry | Description |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| Resale restrictions survive foreclosure | 404 = “Income Based Deed Restrictions Survive” | Restriction period continues post-foreclosure. |
| Resale restrictions terminate upon foreclosure | 404 = “Income Based Deed Restrictions Terminate” | Restriction ends upon foreclosure or deed-in-lieu. |
| Non-profit Affordable Second involved | 368 = “J07” | Also deliver per Section 6302.34(b)(iv)(C). |

---

## Checklist
- [ ] Verify whether restriction **survives** or **terminates** at foreclosure.  
- [ ] Enter **Deed Restriction Term Months Count (90.1)** accurately; use “0” if unknown.  
- [ ] Use correct **Loan Program Identifier (404)**:  
  - “Income Based Deed Restrictions Survive” OR  
  - “Income Based Deed Restrictions Terminate”  
- [ ] If applicable, deliver **Investor Feature Identifier = J07** for qualifying Affordable Seconds.
