Section: 6302.47 – Special Delivery Requirements for Mortgages with Title Insurance  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section establishes **data delivery requirements** for **Mortgages delivered without a traditional title insurance policy**, when the Seller instead provides an **Attorney Opinion of Title Letter** (AOTL).  
Freddie Mac allows AOTLs in limited circumstances, provided all conditions in **Section 4702.3** are met.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- Refer to **Section 4702.1** for Freddie Mac’s **standard title insurance requirements** applicable to all Mortgages.  
- If the Seller delivers a Mortgage **without title insurance**, an **Attorney Opinion of Title Letter** may be used **only if** it complies with **Section 4702.3**.  
- The Seller must certify that the AOTL meets Freddie Mac’s content, form, and attorney eligibility standards.

---

## (b) Data Delivery Instructions

When delivering a Mortgage supported by an **Attorney Opinion of Title Letter (AOTL)** instead of a title insurance policy, the Seller must deliver the following ULDD data element:

| Sort ID | ULDD Data Point | Valid Value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| **LOAN – Current → Product Details** | 368 | **Investor Feature Identifier = J18** | Identifies that the Mortgage was delivered with an **Attorney Opinion of Title Letter** in lieu of title insurance. |

---

## Key Logic
| Scenario | ULDD Field | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Mortgage with standard title insurance policy | — | *No special delivery flag* | Title insurance provided — no identifier required. |
| Mortgage with Attorney Opinion of Title Letter (AOTL) | 368 | J18 | Indicates AOTL per §4702.3. |

---

## Checklist
- [ ] Verify property has **title protection** via either title insurance or a Freddie Mac–approved AOTL.  
- [ ] Ensure the **AOTL** meets all requirements under **Section 4702.3**, including:  
  - Issued by a licensed attorney in good standing in the property’s jurisdiction.  
  - Names Freddie Mac as a covered party.  
  - Provides equivalent coverage to a standard lender’s title policy.  
- [ ] Deliver **Investor Feature Identifier = J18** for loans with AOTL.  
- [ ] Do **not** deliver J18 if a traditional title insurance policy exists.
