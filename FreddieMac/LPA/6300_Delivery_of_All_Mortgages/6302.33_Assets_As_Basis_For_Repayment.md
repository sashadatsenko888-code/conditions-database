Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview
This section specifies **data delivery requirements** for **Mortgages where Borrower assets are used as a basis for repayment**, in accordance with **Section 5307.1**.  
These are transactions where **liquid assets** (e.g., investment accounts, retirement funds) are used to **demonstrate repayment capacity** instead of or in addition to income.

---

## (a) General Requirements
- See **Section 5307.1** for underwriting and eligibility rules governing “assets as a basis for repayment.”  
- The Seller must ensure:
  - Assets meet liquidity and ownership requirements.  
  - Repayment ability is properly documented and calculated.  
  - Assets are converted to an income stream or otherwise used as qualifying support under Freddie Mac guidelines.
