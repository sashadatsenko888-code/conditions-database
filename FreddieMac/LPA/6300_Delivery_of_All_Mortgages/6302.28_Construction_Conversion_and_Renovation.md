## Overview
This section specifies **ULDD data delivery requirements** for **Construction Conversion** and **Renovation Mortgages**, including differences between the three documentation structures:  
1. **Integrated Documentation** (One Closing)  
2. **Separate Documentation** (Two Closing)  
3. **Modification Documentation** (Two Closing with Modification Agreement)

## (a) General Requirements
- See **Chapter 4602** for eligibility, definitions, and workflow for Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages.  
- The documentation structure determines which ULDD fields apply:
  - **Integrated** = combined interim + permanent financing  
  - **Separate** = distinct notes for interim and permanent  
  - **Modification** = interim converts via modification agreement
