## Overview

This section explains the framework for **Warehouse Financing Arrangements**, where a **Seller** uses a **Warehouse Lender** to fund Mortgage originations prior to selling those Mortgages to Freddie Mac.  
It defines how ownership, custody, and delivery of the **Notes** and related documents are managed, and how the relationships between the **Seller**, **Warehouse Lender**, and **Freddie Mac** operate.

---

## Key Concepts

### (a) Definition
A **Warehouse Financing Arrangement** exists when:
- The **Seller** enters into a **Warehouse Agreement** with a **Warehouse Lender**.
- The Seller **grants** the Warehouse Lender either:
  - A **security interest** in certain Mortgages, or  
  - An **ownership interest** in those Mortgages.
- These Mortgages are later **offered for sale to Freddie Mac**.

---

### (b) Custody of Notes and Ancillary Documents
- The **Warehouse Lender** holds:
  - The **original Note**, and sometimes  
  - **Ancillary documents** (e.g., riders, assignments, modification agreements).  
- The **Warehouse Lender** delivers the Note (and any ancillary documents) **to Freddie Mac** on behalf of the Seller, under the Seller’s **Purchase Contract** with Freddie Mac.

---

### (c) Role of the Document Custodian
- Subject to Freddie Mac’s conditions, the **Document Custodian** will **hold the Note** and any **related ancillary documents** for **Pledged Mortgages** while awaiting purchase by Freddie Mac.  
- This ensures:
  - **Proper custody chain** between the Warehouse Lender, Seller, and Freddie Mac, and  
  - **Legal transferability** of interest in the Note.

---

### (d) Relationship Summary
| Party | Role | Key Responsibility |
|--------|------|--------------------|
| **Seller** | Originates and sells Mortgages to Freddie Mac | Executes Warehouse Agreement and retains sale obligation |
| **Warehouse Lender** | Provides interim funding | Holds and pledges Notes to Freddie Mac under Warehouse Agreement |
| **Freddie Mac** | Purchaser of the Mortgage | Acquires Notes once delivery and certification are complete |
| **Document Custodian** | Custody agent for Freddie Mac | Maintains possession of Notes and related documents pending purchase |

---

### (e) eMortgage References
For **Pledged eMortgages**, additional custody and delivery requirements apply under:
- **Section 1402.8(d)** — eMortgage pledge and delivery process  
- **Section 1402.16** — Electronic warehouse lender coordination  

---

## Compliance and Operational Implications
| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Warehouse Agreement Validity** | Must clearly define security or ownership interests granted to Warehouse Lender. |
| **Custody Chain Integrity** | Notes must remain traceable from Seller → Warehouse Lender → Freddie Mac. |
| **Delivery Authorization** | Warehouse Lender delivers Notes per Seller’s Freddie Mac Purchase Contract. |
| **Custodian Holding** | Document Custodian holds Notes and ancillary documents pending purchase. |
| **eMortgage Handling** | For electronic Mortgages, follow §§1402.8(d) and 1402.16 for pledge compliance. |
