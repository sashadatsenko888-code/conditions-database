## Overview

The UAD establishes a consistent data structure, field definitions, and reporting format for residential appraisals to ensure data quality, comparability, and standardization across the industry.

## (a) Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD)
The **UAD** standardizes key appraisal data elements for designated fields across certain **Uniform Residential Appraisal Report forms**.

### Key Points

- The UAD defines **standardized field formats**, **allowable values**, and **data labels** to ensure consistent reporting.  
- The **UAD Specification** document outlines the technical and business requirements for implementation.  
  - It is periodically updated and available on Freddie Mac’s official website:  
     [freddiemac.com](https://www.freddiemac.com)

### Appendix D – Field Standardization
- Appendix D to the Freddie Mac Guide provides **field-specific standardization rules** for completing appraisal report forms subject to UAD.  
- It specifies:
  - Which data must be reported in specific form fields  
  - How those data must be formatted and presented  
  - The exact text, numeric, or coded entries accepted in each field
