Section: 5606.2 – Uniform Collateral Data Portal® (UCDP®)  
Effective Date: 11/06/2024  

---

## Overview
This section describes Freddie Mac’s requirements for the **Uniform Collateral Data Portal® (UCDP®)** — the electronic system used for collecting, transmitting, and validating appraisal data prior to loan delivery.

It also defines Seller responsibilities for UCDP submissions, appraisal report delivery, feedback messaging, and data-use provisions.

---

## (a) Uniform Collateral Data Portal® (UCDP®)
The **UCDP** is Freddie Mac’s official portal for the **electronic submission and collection of appraisal report data**.

- It allows Sellers (or their authorized agents) to deliver appraisal reports directly to Freddie Mac.  
- The portal validates that appraisal reports comply with **UAD (Appendix D)** formatting and data standards before loan delivery.

---

## (b) Delivery of Appraisals through the UCDP
For Mortgages requiring appraisals, the following report forms — including all **exhibits and addenda** — **must be submitted** through the UCDP and receive a **“Successful” status** prior to the **Mortgage Delivery Date**:

| Form No. | Appraisal Report Name |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| **Form 70** | Uniform Residential Appraisal Report |
| **Form 70B** | Manufactured Home Appraisal Report |
| **Form 70D** | Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (Desktop) |
| **Form 70H** | Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (Hybrid) |
| **Form 72** | Small Residential Income Property Appraisal Report |
| **Form 465** | Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report |
| **Form 465H** | Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report (Hybrid) |
| **Form 466** | Exterior-Only Inspection Individual Condominium Unit Appraisal Report |
| **Form 2055** | Exterior-Only Inspection Residential Appraisal Report |
| **Fannie Mae Form 2090** | Individual Cooperative Interest Appraisal Report |

Optional: **Form 442 – Appraisal Update and/or Completion Report** may be submitted at the Seller’s discretion.  
Other Freddie Mac appraisal forms **must not** be submitted to the UCDP.

### Key Seller Responsibilities
- A “Successful” UCDP submission **does not** replace Freddie Mac’s appraisal requirements or the Seller’s **representations and warranties** regarding the appraisal and Mortgaged Premises.  
- The UCDP may be used to verify **UAD (Appendix D)** compliance but does not constitute Freddie Mac’s acceptance of value or collateral eligibility.  
- The Seller’s selection of an appraisal-management company (AMC) or third-party vendor within the UCDP environment **is not an endorsement** by Freddie Mac and does **not** limit Seller obligations, including adherence to Section 3101.1 (Freddie Mac Exclusionary List).

---

## (c) UCDP Messaging
When an appraisal report is submitted through the UCDP, Freddie Mac provides automated **feedback messages** to assist the Seller in assessing the appraisal report’s quality and compliance.

### Message Types
- **Informational or Warning Messages:** Identify potential UAD formatting or appraisal issues.  
  - Presence of warnings **does not** block a “Successful” submission.  
- **Eligibility Messages:** May indicate collateral representation-and-warranty relief eligibility under Section 5602.2.  

### Key Notes
- The absence of feedback messages **does not** imply Freddie Mac’s acceptance of value or compliance.  
- Sellers must still conduct full appraisal-review procedures consistent with Freddie Mac’s underwriting standards.

## (d) Data Submitted to the UCDP
All data transmitted through the UCDP (the “**UCDP Data**”) — including form fields, exhibits, attachments, and metadata — becomes accessible for Freddie Mac’s authorized business uses.

Freddie Mac and its contractors may **use, reproduce, modify, disclose, sublicense, distribute, and retain** all UCDP Data for purposes including but not limited to:

1. **Appraisal and loan processing:** review, quality-control, and delivery validation  
2. **Analytics and modeling:** collateral analytics, performance, risk, and fraud detection  
3. **Operational oversight:** system monitoring, maintenance, and information security  
4. **Regulatory compliance:** adherence to laws, regulations, and lawful orders  
5. **Internal business purposes:** quality assurance and research  
6. **Enforcement:** exercising Freddie Mac’s contractual rights and remedies  

---

## Compliance Reminder
Submitting appraisal data through the UCDP does **not** shift responsibility away from the Seller.  
Sellers remain fully liable for:
- Appraisal accuracy and completeness  
- UAD and Guide compliance  
- Delivery of valid, complete appraisal files before loan sale
