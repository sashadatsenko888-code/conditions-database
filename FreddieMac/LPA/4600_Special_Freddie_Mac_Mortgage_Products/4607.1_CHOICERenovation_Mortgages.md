> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview  

A **CHOICERenovation® Mortgage** is a Freddie Mac offering that allows **financing of property repairs and/or improvements** (“renovations”) through a single first-lien Mortgage.  
Renovations may be completed **before or after the Settlement Date**, and compliance is governed by this **Chapter 4607** and related Seller/Servicer Purchase Documents.

All obligations under this Chapter are **selling requirements**, and **Servicing transfers** are addressed separately in **Section 4607.17**.

---

## Core Concepts  

This section distinguishes between three categories of CHOICERenovation Mortgages and defines the use of Freddie Mac’s **Loan Status Hub®**.

---

### (a) Mortgages with Settlement Dates **After Completion of Renovations**

If renovations are **completed prior to Settlement**, the Seller may deliver the Mortgage **without Freddie Mac’s prior written approval** and is **not subject** to:

- The renovation process requirements in **Sections 4607.9(a)(1–2)** and **4607.9(b)(1–3)**  
- The **contingency reserve** rules in **Section 4607.11(b)**  
- **Recourse** provisions in **Section 4607.14**

Additionally, Mortgages with renovations that are **substantially complete**, where remaining items qualify under **Section 5601.3 (Completion Escrows)**, may still be delivered as CHOICERenovation Mortgages with Settlement Dates **after completion**.

---

### (b) Mortgages with Settlement Dates **Before Completion of Renovations**

A **CHOICERenovation In Progress Mortgage** is defined as a CHOICERenovation Mortgage that:

- Is **not a CHOICEReno eXPress® Mortgage**, and  
- Has renovations **not complete or substantially complete** as of the Settlement Date.  

Such Mortgages must:

- Be sold to Freddie Mac **with recourse** (see **Section 4607.14**), and  
- Obtain **Freddie Mac’s written approval** prior to sale.  
  - Approval requests are submitted through the Seller’s **Freddie Mac representative** or **Customer Service (800-FREDDIE)**.  

> **Occupancy Note:**  
> See **Section 4607.3(b)** for specific occupancy requirements applicable to In-Progress Mortgages.

---

### (c) CHOICEReno eXPress® Mortgages  

A **CHOICEReno eXPress Mortgage** is a simplified subset of CHOICERenovation Mortgages that may be sold to Freddie Mac **without recourse**, provided that:

1. **All renovations are completed within 180 days of the Note Date** (see **Section 4607.4(a)**); and  
2. **Financed renovation costs** meet the limits in **Section 4607.7**.

Sellers of CHOICEReno eXPress Mortgages are **not subject to**:

- The renovation work and process requirements of **Section 4607.9(a)(1)**,  
- The minimum contingency reserve under **Section 4607.11(b)**, or  
- **Recourse** under **Section 4607.14**.

**Freddie Mac’s prior written approval** is **not required** for sale of CHOICEReno eXPress Mortgages.

---

### (d) Loan Status Hub®  

The **Loan Status Hub** is a Freddie Mac system (as defined in **Section 2401.1(b)**) that enables Sellers to **submit renovation-related data, documents, and updates** and receive Freddie Mac’s **output or feedback**.  

Sellers must use **Loan Status Hub** to report required data for:

- **CHOICERenovation In Progress Mortgages**  
- **CHOICEReno eXPress Mortgages**

To obtain access, the Seller must contact their **Freddie Mac representative** or **Customer Service (800-FREDDIE)**.
