## Overview  

Section 4607.13 defines the **property insurance requirements** for all CHOICERenovation® Mortgages, emphasizing compliance during and after renovations.  
It mandates full insurance coverage based on the property’s “as completed” value as determined by the appraiser (§4607.8).

## Core Requirements  

1. **Applicable Insurance Standards:**  
   - CHOICERenovation Mortgages must comply with **Chapter 4703** of the Freddie Mac Guide, which sets the baseline requirements for property insurance coverage.  

2. **Coverage Adjustments During Renovation:**  
   - Insurance coverage may need to be **increased, modified, or supplemented** during the renovation period to reflect changes in construction risk, property value, and insurable interest.  

3. **Coverage Adjustment Upon Completion:**  
   - Once all renovations are complete, insurance coverage must be **updated based on the property’s “as completed” appraised value** (see §4607.8).  
   - The updated insurance policy must meet the full **property insurance requirements of Chapter 8202**.  

4. **Seller’s Responsibility:**  
   - The Seller must ensure that insurance is continuously maintained at all times—  
     - during renovations,  
     - through project completion, and  
     - until the Mortgage sale to Freddie Mac.
