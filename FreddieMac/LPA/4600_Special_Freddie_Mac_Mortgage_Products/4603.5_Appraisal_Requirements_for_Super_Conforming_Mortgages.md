> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  

This section establishes the **appraisal requirements** for **Super Conforming Mortgages** and details when an **Automated Collateral Evaluation (ACE)** or **ACE+ PDR** (Property Data Report) may be accepted in lieu of a traditional appraisal.

---

## Appraisal Requirement  

- The **Seller must obtain an appraisal** that fully meets **Freddie Mac’s appraisal standards** unless the loan qualifies for — and the Seller accepts — an **ACE appraisal waiver** or **ACE+ PDR** offer.  

- The eligibility for such an offer will be displayed on the **Last Feedback Certificate** returned by **Loan Product Advisor® (LPA)**.  

If the certificate includes an **ACE offer** confirming **collateral representation and warranty relief eligibility**, and the Seller elects to accept it, then:  
- No traditional appraisal is required.  
- The property valuation may be validated through the ACE or ACE+ PDR framework.
