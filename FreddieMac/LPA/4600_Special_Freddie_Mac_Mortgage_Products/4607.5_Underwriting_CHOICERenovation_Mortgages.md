> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview  

This section establishes **underwriting, documentation, and debt calculation requirements** for **CHOICERenovation® Mortgages**, including **loan coding**, **Accept classification**, and **temporary rental obligations** during renovation.

---

## (a) Residential Loan Application  

- On **Form 65 (Uniform Residential Loan Application)**, the **Purpose of Loan** must be coded as either:  
  - **Purchase**, or  
  - **Refinance** (as applicable).  
- It **must not** be coded as **Construction** or **Construction-Permanent**.

---

## (b) Uniform Underwriting and Transmittal Summary  

- On **Form 1077 (Uniform Underwriting and Transmittal Summary)**:  
  - The **Loan Purpose** must be coded as **Purchase** or **No Cash-Out Refinance**, not as **Home Improvement**.  
  - The Seller must **indicate in the Underwriter Comments** that the Mortgage is a **CHOICERenovation® Mortgage**.  

This ensures the file is properly classified for Freddie Mac delivery and review.

---

## (c) Accept Mortgages  

- All CHOICERenovation Mortgages must receive a **Loan Product Advisor® “Accept” Risk Class**.  
- Caution or manually underwritten Mortgages are **not eligible** under this section.  

---

## (d) Temporary Rental Payments — Mortgages with Settlement Dates Before Completion of Renovations  

For **CHOICERenovation In Progress** and **CHOICEReno eXPress® Mortgages** secured by **Primary Residences**, if the Borrower rents another property during renovations:

### Documentation  
- The **rental lease** for the temporary domicile must be **included in the Mortgage file**.  

### DTI Inclusion Rules  
The **temporary rental payment** must be included in the **monthly debt payment-to-income ratio** calculation **if either of the following applies**:

| Condition | Requirement |
|------------|--------------|
| More than **10 payments remain** on the lease term as of the Note Date | Include full rental obligation in DTI |
| The **lease includes a renewal or extension option** | Include rental payment in DTI |

If fewer than 10 payments remain and there is **no renewal/extension clause**, the rental expense may be excluded from the DTI calculation.
