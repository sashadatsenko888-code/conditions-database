Section: 4603.4 – Underwriting Requirements for Super Conforming Mortgages  
Effective Date: 08/06/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  

This section outlines the **underwriting requirements** for **Super Conforming Mortgages**, including the process for submission, credit reputation standards, and when **manual underwriting** is required.  

All Super Conforming Mortgages must be evaluated through **Loan Product Advisor® (LPA)** or manually underwritten when specific criteria apply.

---

## (a) General Underwriting Requirements  

- **All Super Conforming Mortgages must be submitted to Loan Product Advisor® (LPA).**  
- The Seller must ensure that the **Loan Product Advisor Key Number** (also referred to as the *Loan Prospector AUS Key Number* in **Loan Selling Advisor**) is entered in the **ULDD Data Point** *Automated Underwriting Case Identifier* for each Super Conforming Mortgage transaction.  

This ensures Freddie Mac can validate that the loan has been properly processed through LPA for eligibility and risk assessment.

---

## (b) Accept Mortgages  

For **Accept Mortgages**, Freddie Mac defines the Borrower’s credit reputation as **acceptable** if the Mortgage receives a **Risk Class of “Accept”** through Loan Product Advisor®.  

- No further manual credit reputation validation is required.  
- The Accept classification provides full AUS-based eligibility for Freddie Mac delivery.

---

## (c) Manually Underwritten Mortgages  

### When Manual Underwriting Is Required  
A Super Conforming Mortgage must be manually underwritten when:  
1. It is a **Caution Mortgage**; or  
2. It was **submitted to Loan Product Advisor but did not receive a Risk Class**.

### Requirements for Manual Underwriting  
Manually underwritten Super Conforming Mortgages must:  
- Comply with the **requirements in Topics 5100 through 5500** (which cover credit, capacity, and collateral standards).  
- Meet the **minimum Indicator Score requirements** specified in **Exhibit 25 – Mortgages with Risk Class and/or Minimum Indicator Score Requirements**.  
- Have an **acceptable credit reputation** without reliance on noncredit payment references (i.e., must use traditional credit sources).
