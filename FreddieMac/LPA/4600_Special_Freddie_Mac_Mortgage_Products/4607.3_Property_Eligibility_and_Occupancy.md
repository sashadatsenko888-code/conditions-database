## Overview  

This section defines the **property eligibility** and **occupancy requirements** applicable to **CHOICERenovation® Mortgages**, including special treatment of occupancy during renovation for **In Progress** and **CHOICEReno eXPress®** loans.

---

## (a) Property Eligibility  

A CHOICERenovation Mortgage must be secured by an **eligible property type**.  
Permissible collateral includes:

| Eligible Property Type | Description / Notes |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| **1- to 4-unit Primary Residence** | Standard owner-occupied property eligible for all CHOICERenovation programs |
| **Second Home** | Eligible under standard Freddie Mac second home requirements |
| **1-unit Investment Property** | Permitted if other CHOICERenovation criteria are met |
| **Manufactured Home (including CHOICEHome®)** | Must meet requirements in **Section 5703.12** |
| **Condominium Unit / PUD / Cooperative Unit** | Eligible only if permitted under the Seller’s Purchase Documents and applicable Freddie Mac guidelines |

> **Note:** All property types must meet Freddie Mac’s general collateral, title, and appraisal standards prior to delivery. See related references in Chapters **5601**, **5605**, and **5701–5703**.

## (b) Special Occupancy Requirement — CHOICERenovation In Progress Mortgages  

When the property is a **Primary Residence** securing either:  
- A **CHOICERenovation In Progress Mortgage**, or  
- A **CHOICEReno eXPress® Mortgage**,  

and the **Borrower does not occupy** the property during renovations, the property will **still be considered owner-occupied** under Freddie Mac rules if the following condition is met:

> The Borrower must occupy the Mortgaged Premises as their **Primary Residence within 60 days** of the **final disbursement** made from the **Custodial Account for Renovation Funds** (as defined in **Section 4607.12**).

This exception allows temporary non-occupancy during renovation while preserving the loan’s **owner-occupied status** for delivery and underwriting purposes.
