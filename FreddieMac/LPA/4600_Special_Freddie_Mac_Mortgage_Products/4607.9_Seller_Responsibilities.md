## Overview  

Section 4607.9 outlines the **Seller’s operational, documentation, and oversight obligations** throughout the CHOICERenovation® renovation period — including management of renovation funds, approval of change orders, communication with Freddie Mac, and third-party accountability.  

---

## (a) Responsibilities During the Renovation Period  

The Seller must:

1. **Manage the Custodial Account for Renovation Funds**  
   - Follow Section **4607.12** for draw processes and fund disbursement.

2. **Handle Change Orders**  
   - Any **Borrower-requested changes** to plans, specs, or completion timelines must be:
     - Documented in a **change order** signed by both **Borrower and contractor**, and  
     - **Approved by the Seller.**  
   - The change order must include:
     - Description of changes  
     - Updated renovation itemization  
     - Revised total renovation cost  
     - Adjusted estimated Completion Date  

3. **Eligibility Restriction**  
   - Seller may **not approve changes** that affect the property or loan metrics (LTV/TLTV/HTLTV) in a way that:
     - Makes the Mortgage ineligible for sale under the Purchase Documents in effect on the Settlement Date, or  
     - Alters the eligibility terms under which it was approved.

---

## (b) Other Seller Responsibilities  

The Seller must ensure full **documentation, oversight, and notification** compliance, including:

### Required Documentation in Mortgage File  
- Renovation costs, purchase contracts, bids  
- Appraisals and renovation contracts  
- Plans, specifications, permits, HOA approvals  
- Change orders, draw records, completion report  
- Custodial Account close-out documentation  
- Title updates ensuring First Lien validity (§4201.2)

> *If paying off short-term renovation financing, include all additional documentation per §4607.6(d).*

### Communication with Freddie Mac  
- Notify Freddie Mac via **Loan Status Hub®** if:
  - Renovations risk **missing the Completion Date**, or  
  - Changes **impact the “as completed” value** from the appraisal.  
- Follow **§4607.4(a)(ii)** to request any **Completion Date extensions**.

### Contractor Requirements  
Unless the Borrower is acting as the general contractor (§4607.10(a)) or purchasing renovations directly from a home improvement store (§4607.10(c)), each contractor/tradesperson must:
- Have a **signed, binding contract** with the Borrower including **indemnification provisions**;  
- Be **licensed and insured** per State/local law;  
- Demonstrate **financial capacity** to complete work on schedule.  

### Title Updates and First Lien Maintenance  
- Seller must ensure **title updates** as needed to maintain compliance with Chapter **4702**.  
- Upon completion, the CHOICERenovation Mortgage must remain a **valid First Lien** (§4201.2).

---

## (c) Notification of Completion  

For **CHOICERenovation In Progress** and **CHOICEReno eXPress** Mortgages:

1. Seller must notify Freddie Mac via **Loan Status Hub** upon completion and provide:
   - **Completion report**,  
   - **Photographs** of finished renovations.  

2. Freddie Mac will provide **written acknowledgment** when:
   - All renovations are complete,  
   - Appraised “as completed” value is satisfied, and  
   - Recourse removal is approved.  

3. Until acknowledgment, the Seller remains **liable** under §4607.9.

4. Failure to notify by the Completion Date may result in **repurchase** obligation.

---

## (d) Seller Responsibilities for Third Parties  

Third parties may perform:
- Processing,  
- Draw inspections,  
- Disbursement management, and  
- Certain administrative tasks.  

However:
- Third parties **may not** open or maintain the **Custodial Account** unless authorized under **§4607.17(a)** (Transfers of Servicing).  
- The **Seller remains fully responsible** for:
  - Accuracy and integrity of third-party data, and  
  - Compliance with all Purchase Document obligations.
