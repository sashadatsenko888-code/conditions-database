> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  

Section 4607.11 defines **funding, reserve, and disbursement rules** for CHOICERenovation® Mortgages.  
It governs:  
1. Deposit and management of renovation funds,  
2. Contingency reserve establishment and limits, and  
3. Disposition of unused funds.  

---

## (a) Renovation Funds  

**Deposit Requirements:**  
- On the **Note Date**, all renovation funds—equal to the **total renovation cost minus any advances** made under §4607.10—must be deposited into:  
  - A **completion escrow account** (meeting §5601.3 requirements for incomplete improvements), or  
  - For **CHOICERenovation In Progress Mortgages**, a **Custodial Account for Renovation Funds** (§4607.12) **on or before Settlement Date**.

**Consistency of Amounts:**  
- The amount in escrow or custodial account must **match the renovation contract costs**, adjusted for any material advances under §4607.10.  

**Borrower Contribution:**  
- If loan proceeds are insufficient, the **Borrower must deposit additional funds** to fully cover renovation costs.

---

## (b) Contingency Reserve  

A **contingency reserve** must be deposited to cover unforeseen renovation expenses.  
Funds may come from **loan proceeds** or **Borrower’s own funds**.

### Exemption  
- Not required for CHOICERenovation Mortgages whose proceeds are **exclusively for outdoor leisure/recreation structures** (§4607.6).

### (i) Minimum Contingency Reserve  
- **CHOICERenovation In Progress Mortgages:**  
  - ≥ **10%** of total renovation cost;  
  - ≥ **15%** if **property utilities are not operable** per renovation plans/specs.

### (ii) Maximum Contingency Reserve  
- ≤ **20%** of total renovation cost for all CHOICERenovation Mortgages.  
- If the Seller **elects** to establish a reserve (when not required, e.g., CHOICEReno eXPress or outdoor-only projects), the reserve **must not exceed 20%.**

---

## (c) Unused Funds  

### (i) When Mortgage Is Current  
After paying all renovation expenses, any unused funds in escrow or custodial accounts must be applied in the following order:  

1. **Reduce the Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB)**;  
2. **Fund additional renovations**, if:  
   - Seller documents disbursement for improvement of the Mortgaged Premises; and  
   - Seller obtains a **completion report** per §4607.8;  
3. **Reimburse Borrower** for funds they contributed to the contingency reserve;  
4. For “no cash-out” refinances, **disburse remaining proceeds** to the Borrower, provided the total amount disbursed (at closing + unused funds) **does not exceed** limits under §4301.4.  

### (ii) When Mortgage Is Delinquent  
If the CHOICERenovation Mortgage is delinquent:  

1. Unused funds must first be applied per the **payment application requirements** in the Note and Security Instrument.  
2. Once the Mortgage is current, remaining unused funds (including non-Borrower contingency funds) must be used for:  
   - **Reducing UPB**, or  
   - **Completing additional renovations** (with documentation and completion report per §4607.8), or  
   - **Reimbursing Borrower’s contributed contingency funds**, or  
   - **Disbursing to Borrower** (for “no cash-out” refinance Mortgages, subject to §4301.4 limits).
