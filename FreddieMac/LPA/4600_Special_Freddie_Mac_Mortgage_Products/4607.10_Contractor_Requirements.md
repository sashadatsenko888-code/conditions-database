- **Licensing:** Borrower is a licensed contractor if required by State or local law.  
- **Insurance:** Borrower maintains insurance appropriate for the renovation scope.

1. **Executed Renovation Contract:**  
   - Must be binding and signed by both Borrower and contractor.  
   - Must include an **indemnification clause** holding the Borrower harmless for any property loss or damage caused by the contractor or its agents.  
   - Must specify completion **no later than the required Completion Date**.

   - These funds may be released **in lieu of** deposits into the **completion escrow account** or **Custodial Account for Renovation Funds** (§§4607.11–4607.12).  
   - This advance is **not permitted** if the Borrower acts as the contractor.

## (c) Renovations Purchased from a Home Improvement Store  

A Borrower may choose a **home improvement store renovation program** if the program requires **payment-in-full at purchase**, provided all of the following conditions are met:

1. **Eligible Mortgage Type:**  
   - The CHOICERenovation® Mortgage must be a **“no cash-out” refinance.**

2. **Seller’s Due Diligence:**  
   The Seller must verify that the home improvement store:
   - Is **financially capable** of completing the renovation and paying its subcontractors;  
   - Maintains a **robust contractor approval process** that is **actively managed and updated**;  
   - Uses only **licensed and insured** contractors/tradespersons; and  
   - Has policies to **replace unapproved or unavailable** contractors without delay.  

3. **Prohibited Roles:**  
   - The Borrower **cannot** be chosen by the home improvement store to perform the renovations, even if licensed.  

4. **Contractual Requirements:**  
   - The home improvement store must have an **executed binding renovation contract** with the Borrower,  
     - specifying completion **by the Completion Date**, and  
     - including an **indemnification clause** covering all property loss or damage caused by its contractors.  

5. **Advance of Renovation Funds:**  
   - Up to **100%** of the materials and renovation costs (including labor) may be **paid directly to the home improvement store at closing** instead of being deposited into a renovation or custodial account, **if** all above conditions are met.
