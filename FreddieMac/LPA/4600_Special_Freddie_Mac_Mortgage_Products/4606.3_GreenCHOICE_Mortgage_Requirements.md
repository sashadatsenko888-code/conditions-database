The Seller/Servicer must retain in the Mortgage file:  
- Copies of **invoices** and/or **receipts** supporting the improvement costs.  
- A **copy of the written escrow agreement** (see below).  

---

### **3. Completion Escrow Account**

- On the **Note Date**, funds sufficient to cover improvement costs must be **deposited into a completion escrow account**.  
- A **written escrow agreement** between the Seller and Borrower must define how funds are managed and disbursed.  
- **Contingency reserves are not required.**  

---

### **4. Escrow Disbursements**

- Funds in the escrow account **may reimburse the Borrower** for the cost of **materials** purchased.  
- **Self-performed labor is not reimbursable.**  
- After all disbursements:
  - If the Mortgage is **delinquent**, apply funds per the Note/Security Instrument payment hierarchy.  
  - If the Mortgage is **not delinquent**, apply any balance to **reduce the unpaid principal balance (UPB)**.

---

### **5. Appraisal and Completion Verification**

- After improvements are completed:
  - The **appraiser must inspect** the property and  
  - Provide a **completion report with photographs** verifying completion.  
  - The report must be **retained in the Mortgage file**.

### **7. Energy Report**

- An **energy report** meeting **Section 4606.4** standards **may be required** depending on improvement type or financing structure.  

---

## (b) Mortgages Used to Pay an Existing Debt  

When loan proceeds are used to **repay a prior energy-related loan or improvement debt (“Existing Debt”)**, the following rules apply:

---

### **1. Use of Proceeds**

- The **maximum payment** toward an Existing Debt is **limited to 15%** of the **appraised value** of the Mortgaged Premises.  

---

### **2. Remaining Existing Debt**

- Any **unpaid balance** must be **included in the borrower’s debt-to-income (DTI)** calculation.  
- If the balance is **reamortized**, documentation must include:
  - The **new payment amount**, and  
  - A **copy of the new promissory note**, if applicable.

---

### **3. Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement**

- The **Settlement/Closing Disclosure** must show that proceeds were **paid directly to the Existing Debt holder**.  
- Proceeds disbursed to the Borrower at closing must **not exceed** the limits in **Section 4301.4** for “no cash-out” refinances.  

---

### **4. Mortgage File Documentation**

- Include documentation (e.g., **invoices, receipts**) for **eligible improvements completed before the Note Date**.  

---

### **5. Appraisal Requirements**

- An **interior and exterior inspection appraisal** is required.  
- The appraisal must **reflect the completed improvements**.
