## Overview  

This section describes the **documentation structures** and **instrument requirements** for converting **Interim Construction Financing** into **Permanent Financing** for both **Construction Conversion Mortgages** and **Renovation Mortgages**.  
It outlines:  
- Uniform Instrument requirements  
- The three documentation methods available  
- The correct use of Freddie Mac Construction Conversion Modification Agreements under specific conditions.  

---

## (a) Required Uniform Instruments  

- **Permanent Financing** must be executed using **Uniform Instruments** authorized for the applicable **Mortgage Product** and **jurisdiction**.  
- The Seller must use:  
  - The **most current State-specific Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Single-Family Security Instrument**,  
  - The **current Uniform Note**, and  
  - Any applicable property-type riders (e.g., ARM Rider, Condo Rider, PUD Rider).  
- See:  
  - **Exhibit 4A** – *Single-Family Uniform Instruments*  
  - **Exhibit 5A** – *Authorized Changes to Notes, Riders, Security Instruments, and the Uniform Residential Loan Application*.

## (b) Types of Documentation for Permanent Financing  

Conversion from Interim Construction Financing to Permanent Financing may use **one of three documentation structures**:

| Documentation Type | Structure | Closings | Required Documentation |
|--------------------|------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Integrated** | One Note and Security Instrument; construction terms added via addendum | 1 (at Interim stage) | - Uniform Security Instrument<br>- Uniform Note (Permanent terms + construction addendum) |
| **Separate** | Two sets of instruments: one for construction, one for permanent financing | 2 (construction + permanent) | - Non-Uniform documents for interim<br>- Uniform Security Instrument + Note for Permanent Financing |
| **Modification** | One Security Instrument; modification converts interim to permanent via agreement | 2 (construction + modification) | - Uniform Security Instrument<br>- Note for interim (Uniform or non-Uniform)<br>- Construction Conversion Modification Agreement (and possibly a new Uniform Note) |

---

## (c) Construction Conversion Modification Agreements  

Modification Documentation is used when Interim and Permanent Financing differ in product, note form, or rate type.  

| Interim Construction Financing Type | Required Documentation | Example Form |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Uniform Note – same Mortgage Product | Execute **Modification Agreement only** (no new Note) | Form 5162 (Fixed) / Form 5163 (ARM) |
| Uniform Note – different Mortgage Product | Execute **Modification Agreement + new Uniform Note + necessary Riders** | Form 5164 |
| Non-Uniform Note | Execute **Modification Agreement + new Uniform Note + necessary Riders** | Form 5164 |
| Conversion from ARM to Fixed | Option to use **Modification with fixed-rate terms embedded** | Form 5165 |

> The Seller may use Freddie Mac’s sample forms or develop its own, provided that:  
> - Provisions are **substantially identical** to the comparable Freddie Mac form; and  
> - The agreement does **not incorporate the Permanent Financing Note** when a new Uniform Note is required.
