## Overview

It outlines when recourse applies, how it can be removed, and under what delinquency or completion conditions repurchase may be required.

## Core Requirements  

### 1. Applicability of Recourse  
- All **CHOICERenovation® In Progress Mortgages** must be **sold with recourse**, as defined under **§6201.7**.  
- Freddie Mac reserves the right to require **repurchase** if the Mortgage becomes **120 days delinquent** while under recourse.  

### 2. Duration of Recourse  
Recourse remains in full effect until **all of the following** occur:  
1. All renovations are fully completed;  
2. The Seller **requests removal of recourse in writing**, specifying the Freddie Mac loan number and including a **completion report** with photographs of the finished renovations; and  
3. **Freddie Mac approves** removal of recourse per the conditions below.

### 3. Request for Removal of Recourse  
To request removal, the Seller must submit all documentation via **Loan Status Hub®** and meet these requirements:  

- The Mortgage **is not delinquent** at the time of request.  
- There has **not been more than one 30-day delinquency** during the renovation period.  
  - If this condition is not met, recourse **may still be removed later** once the Borrower makes **36 consecutive monthly payments** without delinquencies.  
- The Seller must **represent and warrant** that, as of the date Freddie Mac approves the removal, **all requirements in Chapter 4607** have been satisfied.
