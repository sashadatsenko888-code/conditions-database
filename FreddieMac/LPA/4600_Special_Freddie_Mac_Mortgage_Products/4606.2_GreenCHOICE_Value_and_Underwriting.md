Section: 4606.2 – Determination of Value for LTV/TLTV/HTLTV, Underwriting Requirements, and Qualifying Ratios  
Effective Date: 11/06/2024  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  

This section outlines **valuation**, **underwriting**, and **qualifying ratio** requirements for **GreenCHOICE® Mortgages**, which include energy-efficient, water-efficient, or resiliency-improvement loans.  
These rules define how to determine the **loan-to-value (LTV)**, **total loan-to-value (TLTV)**, and **HELOC total loan-to-value (HTLTV)** ratios based on the mortgage purpose and documentation.

---

## (a) Determining Value  

### **Purchase Transactions**

- **Value used for LTV/TLTV/HTLTV calculation** is the **lesser of:**
  1. The **“as completed” appraised value** of the Mortgaged Premises, **or**
  2. The **total acquisition cost**, which equals:  
     → Purchase price of the property **plus** the cost of eligible improvements.

- If the **total acquisition cost** is used, the **Mortgage file must contain supporting documentation** such as:  
  - Contracts, invoices, bids, or receipts showing improvement costs.

---

### **“No Cash-Out” Refinance — Financing Eligible Improvements**

- Use the **“as completed” appraised value** of the Mortgaged Premises to determine the LTV/TLTV/HTLTV ratios.

---

### **“No Cash-Out” Refinance — Paying Existing Debt**

- Use the **current appraised value** (not “as completed”) of the Mortgaged Premises when proceeds pay off an **Existing Debt** used to finance prior eligible improvements.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Mortgage Purpose | Value Used for LTV/TLTV/HTLTV | Required Documentation |
|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Purchase | Lesser of “as completed” appraised value or total acquisition cost | Cost documentation required if acquisition cost used |
| No Cash-Out Refinance (finance new improvements) | “As completed” appraised value | Appraisal supporting completion value |
| No Cash-Out Refinance (pay existing debt) | Current appraised value | Appraisal only |

---

## (b) Underwriting  

- The Mortgage must be either:  
  - An **Accept Mortgage** (receiving a Risk Class of *Accept* from Loan Product Advisor®), **or**  
  - A **Manually Underwritten Mortgage** that satisfies Freddie Mac’s manual underwriting requirements.  

---

## (c) Qualifying Ratios for Manually Underwritten Mortgages  

- Manually Underwritten GreenCHOICE® Mortgages must follow **Section 5401.1(e)(ii)(B)** for ratio calculations:  
  - **Monthly housing expense-to-income ratio**  
  - **Monthly debt payment-to-income ratio**  

These calculations must consider any impact from financed improvements or energy-efficiency debt obligations.
