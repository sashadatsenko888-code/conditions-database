> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview  

This section defines how **property value must be determined** for the purposes of calculating the **loan-to-value (LTV)**, **total loan-to-value (TLTV)**, and **Home Equity Line of Credit TLTV (HTLTV)** ratios for **Construction Conversion** and **Renovation Mortgages**.  

The calculation method varies by **transaction type** (purchase, “no cash-out” refinance, or cash-out refinance) and by **property type** (site-built or manufactured home).  

---

## (a) Purchase Transactions  

| Property Type | Construction Conversion Mortgages | Renovation Mortgages |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| **1- to 4-unit site-built home** | Value is the **lesser of**:  <br>• The **purchase price** of the Mortgaged Premises (land purchase price + total construction costs), **or**  <br>• The **appraised “as completed” value**. | Value is the **lesser of**:  <br>• The **purchase price** of the Mortgaged Premises prior to renovation **plus renovation costs** (including demolition/reconstruction), **or**  <br>• The **appraised “as completed” value**. |
| **1-unit Manufactured Home** | Value is the **lesser of**:  <br>• The **purchase price of the Manufactured Home** + the **lowest purchase price** of the land sold during the **most recent 12 months**, **or**  <br>• The **appraised “as completed” value**. | **Not eligible.** |

> **Special Rule:**  
> If the Borrower acquired the land as a **gift** or by **inheritance**, the **appraised value of the land** may be used **instead of the purchase price**.  

### Cost to Construct or Renovate  
- Only items that are **customarily included** in the cost to build comparable homes in the same area may be included.  
- **Excluded items:** furniture, electronics, entertainment systems, or personal items.

## (b) “No Cash-out” Refinance Transactions  

| Property Type | Construction Conversion Mortgages | Renovation Mortgages |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| **1- to 4-unit site-built home** | Appraised value of the Mortgaged Premises, **as completed** | Appraised value of the Mortgaged Premises, **as completed** |
| **1-unit Manufactured Home** | Appraised value of the Mortgaged Premises, **as completed** | **Not eligible** |

---

## (c) Cash-out Refinance Transactions  

| Property Type | Value Basis |
|----------------|-------------|
| **1- to 4-unit site-built home** | Appraised value of the Mortgaged Premises, **as completed** |
| **1-unit Manufactured Home** | **Not eligible** |

## Compliance Summary  

| Requirement | Description | Reference |
