## Overview  

This section defines **underwriting and resubmission requirements** for **Permanent Financing** of **Construction Conversion** and **Renovation Mortgages**.  
It outlines when re-underwriting or resubmission to **Loan Product Advisor® (LPA)** is required and provides exceptions to streamline compliance.  

---

## (a) Original and Subsequent Underwriting  

### Key Requirements  
- The **Seller must underwrite** the Permanent Financing **before the Effective Date** of Permanent Financing.  
- For Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages, underwriting may occur:
  - **Before or after** the closing of Interim Construction Financing.  
- Changes in financing terms or Mortgage Product are **permitted prior to the Effective Date**.  
- Borrower changes are allowed if requirements of **Section 4602.6** are satisfied.  

### When Re-underwriting Is Required  
If there are changes in the financing terms **or** if the **property value declines** after underwriting:  
- **Non-LPA Mortgages:** Must be **re-underwritten**.  
- **LPA Mortgages:** May require **resubmission** per subsection (b).  

---

## (b) Resubmission of Loan Product Advisor Mortgages  

### General Requirement  
LPA Mortgages must comply with:
- **Chapter 5101**, including **Section 5101.3** (resubmission rules).  

### Exceptions — Resubmission **Not Required** When:  

#### 1. Permitted Change Type  
- The change is one of the **exceptions** listed in **Section 5101.3**.  

#### 2. Decrease in Loan Amount  
Resubmission not required **if** the Permanent Financing meets **all** of the following:  
- **Increased down payment funds** comply with **Chapter 5501**.  
- **Decreased reserves** remain **≥ the required reserves** on the Feedback Certificate.  
- The **loan amount decrease** does **not alter the mortgage insurance coverage level**.  

> Example:  
> - Property Value = $120,000  
> - Original Loan = $114,000 (95% LTV) → May decrease to $109,200 (91% LTV) **without resubmission**.  
> - If loan decreases to $108,000 (90% LTV), **resubmission required** (coverage level changes).  

#### 3. ARM → Fixed-Rate Conversion  
Resubmission not required **if**:  
- The new Mortgage **is not** under a temporary subsidy buydown.  
- The **Borrower qualified** under ARM payment **≥** fixed-rate payment.  
- The **Mortgage term** for both loans is **identical**.  

#### 4. Decrease in Verified Reserves  
Resubmission not required if verified reserves remain **no less than required reserves** on the Feedback Certificate.
