## Overview  

This section clarifies when **Seller-Owned Modified** and **Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages** may or may not be used in the context of **Construction Conversion** and **Renovation Mortgages**.  
It ensures compliance with Freddie Mac’s requirements under **Chapter 4402**, which governs these specialized Seller-retained products.  

---

## Key Requirements  

### (a) Restriction on Conversion or Modification  
- The **Seller-Owned Modified** and **Seller-Owned Converted Mortgage** programs **cannot** be used to **convert or modify Interim Construction Financing** into **Permanent Financing**.  
- In other words, these offerings are **not permissible vehicles** for transitioning from the construction phase to permanent mortgage status.  

---

### (b) Treatment After Permanent Financing  
- **After the Effective Date of Permanent Financing**, if either of the following occurs:
  1. The **terms of the Permanent Financing** are **modified**, or  
  2. An **ARM (Adjustable-Rate Mortgage)** is **converted** into a **fixed-rate Mortgage**,  
  — the resulting loan is considered a **Seller-Owned Modified** or **Seller-Owned Converted Mortgage**.  

These loans must then meet all applicable requirements of **Chapter 4402**.

### (c) Eligibility Restrictions  
The following **Mortgage types are ineligible** to be classified as **Seller-Owned Modified or Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages**:  
- **Home Possible® Mortgages**  
- **HomeOne® Mortgages**
