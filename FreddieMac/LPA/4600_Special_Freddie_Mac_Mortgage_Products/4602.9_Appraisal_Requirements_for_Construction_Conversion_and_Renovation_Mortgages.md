Effective Date: 03/31/2022  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  

This section establishes **appraisal requirements** for **Construction Conversion Mortgages** and **Renovation Mortgages**, ensuring that the appraised value accurately reflects the **“as completed”** condition of the property and complies with **Freddie Mac Topic 5600** standards.

---

## Key Requirements  

### 1. Appraisal Inspection Standard  
- The **Seller must obtain an appraisal** that includes both **interior and exterior inspection**.  
- The appraisal must meet **all Freddie Mac requirements** as detailed in **Topic 5600**.  

---

### 2. Appraisal Information and Documentation  
- The **Seller represents and warrants** that the **originating lender** has provided the appraiser with:  
  - All necessary **plans**,  
  - **Specifications**, and  
  - Other **appraisal-related information** required under **Topic 5600**.  

This ensures the appraiser can accurately assess the **as completed** value.

---

### 3. Appraiser’s Opinion of Value  
- The appraisal must reflect the **“as completed” value** — i.e., the **anticipated market value after all construction or renovation is complete**.  
- This differs from “as-is” appraisals and must factor in all approved project plans.

---

### 4. Appraisal Timing  
- The **effective date** of the appraisal must be **prior to the Effective Date of Permanent Financing**.  
- The appraisal must fully comply with **Topic 5600**, including the detailed requirements of **Section 5604.3** (which governs appraisal validity, updates, and expiration timelines).
