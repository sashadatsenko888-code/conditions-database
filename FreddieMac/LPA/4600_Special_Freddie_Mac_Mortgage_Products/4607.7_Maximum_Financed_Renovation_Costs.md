## Overview  

Section 4607.7 establishes the **maximum allowable financed renovation cost limits** for CHOICERenovation® and CHOICEReno eXPress® Mortgages, based on **transaction type** (purchase or refinance) and **property category** (site-built or manufactured).  

Renovation costs are calculated as a percentage of the **lesser of acquisition or “as completed” appraised value**, subject to Freddie Mac appraisal requirements (§4607.8).  

Properties with **Manufactured Home ADUs** follow the same maximums applicable to their **transaction type**.
