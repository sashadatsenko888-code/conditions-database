- Permit or inspection delays  

#### Eligibility for Extension:

|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Purchase** | Purchase of the property and payment for eligible renovations (§4607.6) |
| **“No Cash-Out” Refinance** | Refinance under §4301.4 rules, except no cash may be disbursed to the Borrower. Includes properties previously owned “free and clear” if proceeds are used solely for eligible renovations (§4607.6). |

At least **one Borrower must be on title for six months or more prior to the Note Date**, unless an exception applies under **§4301.5(b)**.

Each Mortgage must comply with:

- The ratio limits in **§4203.1(b)**, and

| **“No Cash-Out” Refinance** | Appraised “as completed” value |
