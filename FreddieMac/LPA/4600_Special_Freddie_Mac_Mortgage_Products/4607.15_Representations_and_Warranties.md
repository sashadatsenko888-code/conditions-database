Section: 4607.15 – Representations and Warranties for CHOICERenovation® Mortgages  
Effective Date: 10/02/2024  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview  

Section 4607.15 specifies the **representation and warranty framework** for CHOICERenovation® Mortgages.  
It ties eligibility for Freddie Mac’s representation and warranty relief to borrower payment performance over the first 36 months following completion of renovations and transition from escrow-funded to borrower-paid payments.

---

## Core Requirements  

### 1. Applicable Framework  
- The **selling representation and warranty framework** in **Section 1301.11** applies to CHOICERenovation® Mortgages that satisfy all requirements of **Chapter 4607**.  
- This includes Freddie Mac’s standard criteria for relief from certain life-of-loan representations after satisfactory borrower performance.

### 2. Trigger for Framework Applicability  
The framework becomes effective **once borrower payments begin directly from the borrower’s own funds**, rather than from:  
- The **completion escrow account**, or  
- The **Custodial Account for Renovation Funds**,  
as described in **Sections 4607.11** and **4607.12**.

### 3. Borrower Payment Performance Conditions  
To qualify for representation and warranty relief under §1301.11, the Borrower must have:  

- Made the **first 36 monthly payments** due after renovations began without:  
  - More than **two 30-day delinquencies**, and  
  - **No 60-day or greater delinquencies**.  
- Been **current (not 30+ days delinquent)** with respect to the **36th monthly payment**.  

### 4. Seller Implications  
- Only after these criteria are satisfied does Freddie Mac’s representation and warranty relief apply.  
- If the borrower fails to meet the required payment history, the Seller retains full representation and warranty obligations.
