Section: 4606.4 – Energy Reports

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

## Overview  

This section establishes **energy report requirements** for **GreenCHOICE® Mortgages** when financing or reimbursing eligible energy-efficient improvements. It defines when reports are required, acceptable report types, validity conditions, renewable energy exceptions, and permitted documentation alternatives.

---

### General Rule  

| Improvement Cost | Energy Report Requirement |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| ≤ $6,500 | **Not required** |
| > $6,500 | **Required** – Must be obtained and retained in the Mortgage file |
| “No cash-out” refinance (paying Existing Debt) | **Not required** |

---

## (a) Eligible Energy Reports  

The energy report must be one of the following **qualified types**:

1. **HERS Report** –  
   A *Home Energy Rating System (HERS)* report completed by a certified **RESNET® Home Energy Rater** showing a **HERS Index ≤ 90**.  
   → [RESNET Directory](http://www.resnet.us/directory/search)

2. **DOE Home Energy Score Report** –  
   Completed by a certified **DOE Home Energy Score Assessor™**, showing a **score ≥ 6**.  
   → [DOE Home Energy Score Map](https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/home-energy-score/home-energy-score-map)

3. **Comparable Energy Rating or Audit** –  
   A comparable rating report or audit prepared by a **certified home energy rater or consultant**, indicating that the property qualifies as a **high-performing energy-efficient property**.

---

## (b) Energy Report Conditions  

All required reports must:

- **Identify**: Each energy improvement and the expected completion cost.  
- **Quantify**: Estimated **monthly or annual energy savings**.  
- **Verify cost effectiveness**:  
  - Total expected cost (including maintenance) **must be less than** the present value of energy savings over the system’s useful life.  
- **Date Validity**: Report must be dated **within 24 months before or after the Note Date**.  
- **Cost Inclusion**:  
  - The report’s cost may be **included in total eligible improvement costs** and  
  - Must appear on the **Settlement Statement** if the Borrower is reimbursed.  

---

## (c) Energy Report Exceptions – Renewable Energy Sources  

When improvements involve **renewable energy systems** (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, geothermal), and **no standard energy report is available**, cost-effectiveness can be demonstrated by **documentation and income analysis** instead:

### Required Evidence:
1. **Invoices/receipts** showing full system cost and maintenance expenses.  
2. **Comparison** of cost (net of tax credits/rebates) to **income produced** over system life.

If the **income produced exceeds the net cost**, the system is considered **cost-effective**.

### Appraisal Documentation:
- The **appraiser must document projected income** using one of the following:
  - **PV Value**
  - **Ei Value**
  - Or another comparable valuation tool per **Section 5601.4**.

---

## (d) Energy Report Alternatives  

In specific cases, Freddie Mac permits **alternative documentation** instead of a full energy report, as shown below:

| Improvement Type | Permitted Alternative Documentation |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| **ENERGY STAR® Products** | Invoices, receipts, or product listings showing that items are ENERGY STAR–certified and appear on the official ENERGY STAR list. |
| **Health & Safety Improvements** | One of: <br>– Invoices/receipts showing costs and expected impact (e.g., radon level reduction) <br>– A completed **EPA Indoor airPLUS Verification Checklist** (Version 1 Rev. 04 or higher) |
| **Resiliency or Preventative Improvements** | One of: <br>– Invoices/receipts documenting repair or reinforcement costs (e.g., contractor invoices) <br>– **IBHS FORTIFIED Home™ designation certificate** (FORTIFIED Roof, Silver, or Gold level) |

---

## Compliance Summary  

| Category | Requirement | Reference |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Energy report threshold | Required if aggregate improvement cost > $6,500 | §4606.4 |
| Not required | For Existing Debt refinances | §4606.4 |
| Valid report types | HERS (≤90), DOE Score (≥6), or equivalent certified audit | §4606.4(a) |
| Validity period | Within 24 months of Note Date | §4606.4(b) |
| Cost inclusion | May be financed and must appear on Settlement Statement if reimbursed | §4606.4(b) |
| Renewable exception | Document invoices + income > cost using PV Value or equivalent | §4606.4(c) |
| Alternatives | ENERGY STAR docs, EPA Indoor airPLUS checklist, or IBHS FORTIFIED certificate | §4606.4(d) |
