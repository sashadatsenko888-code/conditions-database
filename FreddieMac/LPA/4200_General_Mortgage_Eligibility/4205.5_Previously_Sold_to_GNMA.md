Section: 4205.5 – Mortgage Previously Sold to the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA)  
Effective Date: 04/02/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
A **Mortgage previously sold to the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA)** and subsequently **repurchased** from GNMA, or any **Mortgage on which a GNMA price differential has been paid**, may be eligible for sale to Freddie Mac — provided that it **meets all requirements of the Purchase Documents** at the time it is offered for sale.

---

## Eligibility Summary

| Criteria | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Prior GNMA Sale** | Mortgage may have been previously pooled into a GNMA security or sold directly to GNMA. |
| **Repurchase Status** | Must have been legally **repurchased** from GNMA or otherwise released from GNMA pool. |
| **GNMA Price Differential** | If a GNMA price differential was paid, this does not disqualify the loan from Freddie Mac purchase. |
| **Compliance Point** | The Mortgage must **fully meet all Freddie Mac Purchase Document requirements** (Guide, contracts, representations and warranties, delivery conditions, etc.) **as of the date of resale to Freddie Mac.** |
| **Delivery Restrictions** | No additional GNMA or FHA/VA recourse obligations may remain attached at the time of sale. |

### Interpretive Notes
- This section enables **liquidity recovery** for loans transitioned from **GNMA securitization** to **Freddie Mac conventional channels**.  
- Eligibility depends **solely on the Mortgage’s compliance** with Freddie Mac’s current standards — not on prior GNMA status or price differential.  
- All **data, documentation, and warranty conditions** are assessed as if the Mortgage were newly originated at the time of sale.  

---

### Compliance Emphasis
The Seller must ensure that:
1. Any prior GNMA obligations have been **fully satisfied or released**.  
2. The repurchased Mortgage now meets Freddie Mac’s **loan-level eligibility, collateral, and delivery standards**.  
3. The Mortgage file includes documentation evidencing **repurchase or GNMA release**.
