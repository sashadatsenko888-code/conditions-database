> **Condition-Relevant Section â€” Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines Freddie Macâ€™s eligibility requirements for **amortization structure** and **original term** of all Mortgages delivered to Freddie Mac.  
It ensures that loans are fully amortizing and within acceptable term limits by program type.

---

## (a) Amortization
- The **Note must provide for full amortization** by maturity through **regular monthly payments**.  
- Amortization must **begin no later than 62 days after the final disbursement** of Mortgage proceeds.

---

## (b) Term

- The **original maturity** of any Mortgage delivered to Freddie Mac must **not exceed 30 years** from the **Origination Date**.  
- Program-specific term limits apply as follows:

| Program | Minimum Original Maturity from Origination Date | Maximum Original Maturity from Origination Date |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **10-Year Program** | > 84 months | 10 years |
| **15-Year Program** | > 84 months | 15 years |
| **20-Year Program** | > 15 years | 20 years |
| **30-Year Program** | > 15 years | 30 years |

> *For Construction Conversion Mortgages or Renovation Mortgages, the term begins on the **Effective Date of Permanent Financing** rather than the initial disbursement date.*
