## Overview
Freddie Mac prohibits the purchase of any Mortgage containing a **mandatory arbitration clause**.  
These provisions restrict a Borrower’s right to seek judicial relief and are considered inconsistent with Freddie Mac’s consumer protection standards and Uniform Instrument requirements.

---

## Ineligibility Rule
A Mortgage is **ineligible for purchase** if **any** of the following Mortgage documents contain a mandatory arbitration clause:

- The **Note** or any **Note addendum**  
- The **Security Instrument** (e.g., Deed of Trust or Mortgage)  
- Any **Security Instrument rider**  
- Any **ancillary Mortgage document**

A **mandatory arbitration clause** is defined as any term that **obligates the Borrower to submit to arbitration** any dispute arising out of or relating to the Mortgage transaction.

---

## Authorized Instrument Language
Freddie Mac’s **Uniform Instruments** do **not include** mandatory arbitration clauses, and:  
- The **addition** of such a clause is **not an authorized modification**; and  
- **No ancillary Mortgage document** may contain any mandatory arbitration provision.
