## Overview
This section defines Freddie Mac’s requirements for **Temporary Subsidy Buydown Plans** (“buydown plans”) — arrangements that provide a short-term reduction of the borrower’s monthly principal and interest payments.  
Freddie Mac purchases **Limited Buydown Mortgages** and **Extended Buydown Mortgages** only when they meet all eligibility, underwriting, funding, and documentation conditions in this section and the applicable Purchase Documents.  

> Home Possible® and HeritageOne® Mortgages with buydowns must also meet Sections 4501.5 and 4504.5.

## (a) Eligible Buydown Plans

### Limited Buydown Mortgage
- Initial interest rate temporarily reduced ≤ **2 percentage points** below Note Rate  
- Annual increase ≤ **1 percentage point** for no more than **2 years** from first payment date  

### Extended Buydown Mortgage
- Initial interest rate temporarily reduced by **> 2 but ≤ 3 percentage points** below Note Rate  
- Annual increase ≤ **1 percentage point** for **> 2 but ≤ 3 years** after first payment date  

---

## (b) Ineligible Mortgages
The following Mortgages are **not eligible** for any temporary buydown plan:

- 3/6-Month ARMs  
- 5/6-Month ARMs secured by 3- or 4-unit Primary Residences  
- Cash-out refinances  
- No-cash-out refinances where the buydown is funded through a lender credit derived from an interest-rate increase  
- Investment Property Mortgages  

**Global limits:**
- Initial rate reduction ≤ 3 percentage points below Note Rate  
- Buydown period ≤ 3 years after first scheduled payment  

---

## (c) Special Underwriting Requirements

### (i) Qualification for Debt Ratios
- **Fixed-Rate Mortgages:** qualify using monthly payments at the **Note Rate**, or a rate ≥ the maximum rate applicable during the first five years after closing.  
- **ARMs:** qualify per Section 4401.2 (ARM qualifying rate rules).  

### (ii) Reserves Calculation
- When reserves are required, they must be computed using the **Note Rate** —not the temporarily reduced rate.

---

## (d) Special Documentation Requirements
The Mortgage file must include:

1. Executed **buydown agreement**  
2. Seller’s calculations showing:  
    - Total cost of the buydown plan  
    - Interested-party contributions  
    - Annual percentage increase in Borrower’s P&I payment during buydown period  

### Buydown Agreement Must State
- Buydown funds will be **automatically applied each month** to reduce Borrower’s P&I payment  
- If funds are unavailable or unpaid, Borrower remains obligated for **full Note payments**  
- Borrower **may not assign, transfer, close, or withdraw** from the buydown account except as permitted

## (e) Other Requirements

### (i) Custodial Account Funding
- Every buydown plan must be **fully funded at origination**.  
- See Sections 8302.1(a)(ii) and 8302.2(b) for Custodial Account maintenance rules.  

### (ii) Note and Security Instrument Provisions
- The **Note** and **Security Instrument** must not reference the buydown plan.  
- Buydown agreements cannot alter the Note terms.  
- Interest rate and payment amounts shown in the Note must exclude any temporary subsidy effects.  

### (iii) Servicing Requirements
If the Mortgage is:  
- **Foreclosed:** remaining buydown funds must be applied to reduce the Mortgage debt.  
- **Paid in full:** remaining funds distributed per the buydown agreement.  
- **Assumed by a buyer:** funds may continue to reduce payments under original terms.
