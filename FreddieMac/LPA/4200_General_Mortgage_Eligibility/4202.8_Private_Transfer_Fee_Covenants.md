## Overview
Freddie Mac will **not purchase** any Mortgage secured by a property encumbered by a **private transfer fee covenant** prohibited under **12 C.F.R. Part 1228**, if that covenant was **created on or after February 8, 2011**.

This rule prevents Freddie Mac from purchasing loans tied to property transfer fees that benefit private parties rather than legitimate homeowners’ associations or shared equity structures.

---

## Ineligibility Rule
A Mortgage is **ineligible for sale** to Freddie Mac if:

- The property securing the Mortgage is encumbered by a **private transfer fee covenant** prohibited by **12 C.F.R. Part 1228**, and  
- The covenant was **created on or after February 8, 2011**.

---

## Seller Representations and Warranties
The Seller/Servicer must:

1. Maintain **internal controls** to ensure ineligible Mortgages are not inadvertently delivered to Freddie Mac; and  
2. Obtain **representations and warranties** from any prior holder or originator confirming that:  
   - The property securing the Mortgage is **not encumbered** by a prohibited private transfer fee covenant created on or after February 8, 2011.

## Permissible Exception — Shared Equity Loans
Private transfer fees are permissible **only** when all the following conditions are met:

1. The Mortgage is a **shared equity loan**, and  
2. The Mortgage satisfies the **Duty to Serve shared equity loan program criteria** under **12 C.F.R. § 1282.34(d)(4)** (other than the 100% AMI cap), and
