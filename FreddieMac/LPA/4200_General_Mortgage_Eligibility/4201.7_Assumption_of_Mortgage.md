> **Condition-Relevant Section â€” Include in Ruleset**

## Overview
This section defines Freddie Macâ€™s eligibility standards for **assumed Mortgages**â€”loans where the original Borrower has transferred ownership of the Mortgaged Premises to a new owner who assumes the debt.  
Only properly documented and underwritten assumptions are eligible for purchase.

---

## Core Requirements

A Mortgage **not owned by Freddie Mac** is eligible for purchase **after an assumption** if the following conditions are met:

1. **Written Assumption Agreement**
   - The **new owner** must be **legally obligated** by a **written assumption agreement** to repay the indebtedness secured by the Mortgaged Premises.

2. **Full Underwriting and Qualification**
   - The **new owner** must be **fully underwritten and qualified** according to Freddie Macâ€™s credit and collateral standards.  
   - Underwriting must comply with **Topics 5100 through 5500** of the Guide and any applicable sections for the loan type.

3. **Product-Specific Compliance**
   - For example, if the Mortgaged Premises is a **Manufactured Home**, the assumption must also meet the provisions of **Chapter 5703**.
