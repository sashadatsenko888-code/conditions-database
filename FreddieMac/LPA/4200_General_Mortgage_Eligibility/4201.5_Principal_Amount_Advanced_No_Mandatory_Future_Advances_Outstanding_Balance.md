## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Macâ€™s requirements that the Mortgage be **fully disbursed**, **non-revolving**, and that its **outstanding principal balance** accurately reflects a fully secured, closed-end loan.  

These requirements ensure Freddie Macâ€™s collateral and balance integrity at purchase.

## Core Requirements

1. **Full Principal Disbursement**
   - The **entire principal amount** of the Mortgage must have been **disbursed or advanced** to the Borrower,  
     or disbursed **according to the Borrowerâ€™s direction** before sale to Freddie Mac.

2. **No Future Advances**
   - The **Security Instrument** must not permit the Borrower to **borrow additional funds** under the same lien or obligation.  
   - No **mandatory future advances** may exist that would alter Freddie Macâ€™s lien or balance position.

3. **Outstanding Balance**
   - The **outstanding principal balance** represented by the Seller must:
     - Accurately reflect the **true unpaid balance**, and  
     - Be **fully secured** by the Security Instrument.
