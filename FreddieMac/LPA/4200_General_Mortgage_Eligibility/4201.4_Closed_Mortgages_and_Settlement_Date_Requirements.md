## (a) Closed Mortgage Requirements
- The Mortgage must be **closed prior to delivery** to Freddie Mac.  
- **Final disbursement of proceeds** constitutes the closing.  
- **Construction Conversion** and **Renovation Mortgages** must be delivered **after** the **Effective Date of Permanent Financing**.  
- The Mortgage must be closed **in the Sellerâ€™s name as lender**, or **validly assigned/endorsed** to the Seller as **holder-in-due-course**.

---

## (b) Settlement Date Requirements
- The **Settlement Date** must occur **no later than six months after** the:
  - **Note Date**, or  
  - **Effective Date of Permanent Financing** (for Construction Conversion / Renovation Mortgages â€“ see Chapter 4602), or  
  - **Modification Date** (for Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages â€“ see Chapter 4402), or  
  - **Conversion Date** (for Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages â€“ see Chapter 4402), or  
  - **NY CEMA Date** (for New York refinances â€“ see Section 4101.11).

**Exception:**  
For **CHOICERenovationÂ® Mortgages** where Settlement occurs **after completion of renovations**, the Settlement Date may be **up to 450 days after the Note Date** (see Section 4607.4(a)).
