## Overview
This section outlines Freddie Macâ€™s requirements and best practices for **Escrow Accounts**.  
While Freddie Mac generally does **not require Escrows**, Sellers must comply with exceptions, maintain written policies for waiving Escrows, and ensure Borrowers can manage non-escrowed obligations responsibly.

---

## (a) Escrow Accounts
Freddie Mac **does not require Escrow accounts** except in the following cases:
1. For the **collection of Borrower-paid mortgage insurance (MI)** paid monthly (see Â§ 4701.2), and  
2. When **required by applicable law**.

---

## (b) Seller Policy for Not Requiring Escrows
- Sellers that sell Mortgages **without Escrow accounts** must:
  - **Establish and maintain a written policy** governing when Escrows are not required.
  - Base each waiver decision on a documented **evaluation of the Borrowerâ€™s ability** to make all related payments as due, including:
    - Property hazard insurance premiums  
    - Real estate taxes  
    - Ground rents and other potential **First Lien charges**  
    - Special assessments  

> Sellers **may not waive Escrow requirements** for:
> - Borrower-paid mortgage insurance collected monthly  
> - Any Escrows required by law  

---

## (c) Best Practices
Freddie Mac **encourages (but does not require)** Escrows for higher-risk loan categories, including:

- Mortgages to **First-Time Homebuyers**  
- **Home PossibleÂ®** Mortgages  
- **HomeOneÂ®** Mortgages  
- Mortgages secured by **2â€“4-unit properties**  
- Mortgages secured by **Manufactured Homes**  
- **Second Home** Mortgages  
- **Investment Property** Mortgages  
- Mortgages where the Borrower has **less than six months of reserves**  
- **Refinance Mortgages** where **taxes were past due** on the refinanced loan
