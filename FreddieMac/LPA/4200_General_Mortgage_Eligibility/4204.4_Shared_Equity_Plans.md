## Overview
Freddie Mac does **not** pre-approve individual shared-equity plans.  
However, Freddie Mac **may** purchase Mortgages subject to a shared-equity agreement **only if** every requirement in this section is satisfied and fully documented in the Mortgage file.

A **shared-equity plan** is a written agreement under which an owner-occupant and an owner-investor jointly acquire a property and share ownership, equity growth, and related rights and obligations.

- A **Mortgage application**, **financial statements**, and **credit reports** for **both** the **owner-occupant** and the **owner-investor**.  
- All information must be evaluated in accordance with standard underwriting requirements.

### (2) Compliance with Purchase Documents
