## Seller Representations & Warranties
The Seller/Servicer must:
1. Maintain written **policies and procedures** aligned with the listed State laws to prevent the inadvertent delivery of ineligible Mortgages.  
2. Obtain **representations and warranties** from any prior holder or correspondent confirming that no Mortgage is “high-cost,” “high-risk,” or “covered.”  
3. Ensure **no structuring, loan-splitting, or subterfuge** was used to evade State law restrictions (e.g., creating concurrent subordinate liens).
