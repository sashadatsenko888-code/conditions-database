Section: 4202.6 – ATR/QM Rule Eligibility and Compliance  
Effective Date: 07/02/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines Freddie Mac’s requirements for determining **Ability-to-Repay (ATR)** and **Qualified Mortgage (QM)** eligibility under Regulation Z (12 C.F.R. § 1026.43).  
It governs which Mortgages Freddie Mac will purchase and under what conditions.

Freddie Mac will not make a legal or regulatory determination of ATR/QM compliance — all compliance determinations remain the **Seller’s responsibility**.

Exempt Mortgages are not subject to the Revised General QM Rule but must still satisfy:  
- **Points-and-fees ≤ 5 % of total loan amount**, and  
- **APR – APOR spread < 6.5 percentage points**  

Sellers must document and justify exemption status.

- **Exempt Mortgages:** APR < APOR + 6.5 %.

## (g) Determination of Regulatory Compliance
Freddie Mac does **not** determine ATR/QM status.  
Responsibility for compliance and accurate designation lies entirely with the **Seller**.

---

## (h) Responsible Lending
Sellers must ensure that **all ATR Covered Mortgages** satisfy the **Revised General QM Rule**,  
even if they are not legally required to do so under federal or state law.

---

## (i) Government-Funded, Guaranteed, or Insured Mortgages
See **Chapter 4205** for additional requirements.
