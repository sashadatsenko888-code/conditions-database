## Overview
This section establishes Freddie Mac’s requirements for calculating and applying **loan-to-value (LTV)**, **total loan-to-value (TLTV)**, and **home equity line-of-credit TLTV (HTLTV)** ratios, as well as the **maximum original loan amounts** eligible for sale.  
It governs both **Loan Product Advisor®** and **Non-Loan Product Advisor** Mortgages.

---

## (a) Calculating LTV, TLTV, and HTLTV Ratios

### (i) Determining “Value”

| Mortgage Type | “Value” Definition |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Purchase transaction** | The lesser of (1) the appraised value as of the appraisal report effective date, or (2) the purchase price. Multiple contracts for new construction (e.g., home + pool) may be combined. |
| **Refinance** | The appraised value as of the appraisal report effective date. |
| **Community Land Trust Mortgages** | See Section 4502.5. |
| **Construction Conversion / Renovation Mortgages** | See Section 4602.10. |
| **CHOICERenovation® Mortgages** | See Section 4607.4. |
| **GreenCHOICE Mortgages®** | See Section 4606.2. |
| **Freddie Mac Enhanced Relief Refinance®** | See Section 4304.7. |

**New York Exception:**  
For mortgage-insurance purposes only, “value” = the appraised value on the Note Date (or Cooperative Interest sales price for co-ops). This definition applies solely to MI determinations.  
→ See Section 4701.5 and Chapter 4701 for MI rules.

---

### (ii) Calculation — Loan Product Advisor® Mortgages  
LPA automatically computes LTV, TLTV and HTLTV ratios from Seller-submitted data.  
For certain LPA transactions, “value” may be the Seller-provided estimate or purchase price when ACE or ACE+ PDR eligibility applies (see Sections 5602.3 and 5602.4).

---

### (iii) Calculation — Non-LPA Mortgages  

| Ratio | Formula |
|--------|----------|
| **LTV** | 1st lien amount ÷ “value” |
| **TLTV** | (1st lien + disbursed secondary financing) ÷ “value” |
| **HTLTV** | (1st lien + HELOC credit line limit + other secondary financing) ÷ “value” |

---

## (b) Maximum LTV, TLTV and HTLTV Ratios

### (i) Rounding  
Ratios are rounded **up** to the next whole percent (e.g., 94.01% → 95%).  
Freddie Mac calculates each ratio to two decimals and rounds up at delivery.

---

### (ii) Standard Maximum Ratios  

#### Purchase / No-Cash-Out Refinance (Fixed and ARM)

| Property Type | Accept Mortgages | Manually Underwritten / Super Conforming |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1-unit Primary Residence | 95% | 95% |
| 2-unit Primary Residence | 95% | 85% |
| 3–4-unit Primary Residence | 95% | 80% |
| Second Home | 90% | 90% |
| 1-unit Investment Property | 85% | 85% |
| 2–4-unit Investment Property | 75% | 75% |

#### Cash-Out Refinance (Fixed and ARM)

| Property Type | Max LTV/TLTV/HTLTV |
|----------------|--------------------|
| 1-unit Primary Residence | 80% |
| 2–4-unit Primary Residence | 75% |
| Second Home | 75% |
| 1-unit Investment Property | 75% |
| 2–4-unit Investment Property | 70% |

|-------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | $806,500 | $1,209,750 |
| 2 | $1,032,650 | $1,548,975 |
| 3 | $1,248,150 | $1,872,225 |
| 4 | $1,551,250 | $2,326,875 |

> Mortgages exceeding these limits may still qualify as **super-conforming** if they meet Chapter 4603 requirements.

### Determining the Loan Amount for Limit Compliance  

| Mortgage Type / Characteristic | Amount Used to Test Compliance |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Seller-Owned Modified Mortgage | Original Note amount |
| Seller-Owned Converted Mortgage | ARM Note amount |
| Construction / Renovation (Integrated Docs) | Interim Construction Financing amount from integrated Note |
| Construction / Renovation (Modification Docs) | Higher of Interim Note or Permanent Modification Agreement |
| Construction / Renovation (Separate Docs) | Permanent Financing Note amount |
| Future Advances (consolidated before Delivery) | Original Note amount ≥ consolidated principal |
| Principal Curtailment (before Delivery) | Note amount |
| Financed MI Premiums | Note amount (including financed premium) |

> Note: For these cases, the “loan amount” used for eligibility testing may differ from the ULDD Note Amount or the figure used for LTV calculation. See Chapter 6302 for delivery instructions.
