## Overview
This section outlines Freddie Mac‚Äôs requirements for **future advances** made **before or after** the purchase of a Home Mortgage.  
It distinguishes between eligible pre-purchase advances and prohibited post-purchase advances.

---

## (a) Future Advances Made Before Purchase
Freddie Mac will **purchase Home Mortgages** with future advances made **before the Delivery Date**, provided that:

1. **Consolidation:**  
   The advances are **consolidated** with the outstanding principal amount secured by the Mortgage, and the total consolidated amount:
   - Bears a **single interest rate and repayment term**.

2. **Lien Priority:**  
   The lien securing the consolidated principal amount must be **expressly insured as a First Lien**, verified by:
   - A **title insurance policy**,  
   - An **endorsement** insuring the consolidated mortgagee‚Äôs interest, or  
   - **Other title evidence** acceptable to Freddie Mac.

3. **Loan Amount Limit:**  
   The consolidated principal amount **must not exceed** the **original loan amount**.

4. **Rider Requirement (for Uniform Instruments without covenant for advances):**  
   Sellers may attach a **Future Advances Rider** that:
   - Permits future advances only up to a **specified cutoff date**, which must occur **before the sale** of the Mortgage to Freddie Mac.  
   - Includes the mandatory provision:  
     > ‚ÄúNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the ability of the lender, its successors and assigns, to enforce the repayment of future advances made prior to the sale of the Mortgage to Freddie Mac shall remain in full force and effect.‚Äù

## (b) Advances Made After Purchase
Once a Home Mortgage has been **sold to Freddie Mac (in whole or in part)**,  
the **Seller or Servicer may not make any additional advances.**
