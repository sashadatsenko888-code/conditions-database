Section: 4101.9 â€“ Due-on-Sale Provisions  
Effective Date: 07/09/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section â€” Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview
This section defines the **due-on-sale provisions** contained in Freddie Macâ€™s Uniform Instruments.  
These provisions determine whether a loan must be accelerated or may be assumed by a third party upon transfer of the Mortgaged Premises.

---

## (a) Description of Due-on-Sale Clauses
Each Uniform Instrument specifies whether the Mortgage:
- Must be **accelerated** if the Borrower sells or transfers any interest in the Mortgaged Premises, or  
- May be **assumed** by a third party acquiring the property.

The type of clause used defines whether the Mortgage is **assumable or nonassumable**, and this varies by product type (Fixed-Rate or ARM).

---

## (b) Types of Due-on-Sale Clauses

| Type | Description | Effect |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Nonassumable during life of loan** | Loan is immediately accelerated upon transfer. | Mortgage is nonassumable (used for most Fixed-Rate Mortgages). |
| **Assumable during life of loan** | Lender evaluates transferee as if making a new loan; may approve assumption if security not impaired. | Mortgage is assumable (applies to ARM Instruments). |
| **Assumable until specified event, then nonassumable** | Mortgage can be assumed until a defined event occurs. | Assumability ends after event. |
| **Nonassumable during specified period, then assumable** | Mortgage nonassumable for an initial period; becomes assumable after (e.g., end of Initial Period for ARM). | 6-Month SOFR-indexed ARMs follow this pattern. |
| **Nonassumable â†’ Assumable â†’ Nonassumable again** | Multi-stage clause defining when assumption is allowed. | Complex assumption control. |

## (c) Summary of Due-on-Sale Characteristics

- **Fixed-Rate Mortgages**
  - Generally must be **nonassumable**.  
  - Exceptions: *Fixed-Rate Assumable Mortgages* sold under the **Guarantor Program** require:
    - A **Note Addendum** and **Security Instrument Rider** designating the loan as assumable; and  
    - **Written approval from Freddie Mac** before sale.

- **6-Month SOFR-Indexed ARMs**
  - May be originated either as:
    - Fully **assumable** for the life of the loan, or  
    - **Nonassumable during the Initial Period**, then **assumable thereafter**.

- **Other Products (FHA / VA)**  
  - May have different due-on-sale characteristics as defined by their respective program requirements.

---

## (d) Exceptions for Law and Certain Circumstances
Even if a Mortgage is stated to be **nonassumable**, Freddie Mac will permit it to be assumed if:
- Required by **federal or State law**, or  
- Allowed under **Sections 8406.1(d)** and **8406.2(a)** of the Guide.
