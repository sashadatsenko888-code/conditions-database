---

## (a) Exhibit documentation requirements

### (i) Photographs
- **Subject**: Original, clear color photos; show improvements, any deterioration, amenities, conditions, or external influences impacting value/marketability.
- **Comparables**: Clear photos (MLS photos acceptable).

### (ii) Building sketch & floor plan
- **Sketch** must include: perimeter dimensions with area calcs; all levels; separate sketches for additional structures; exterior dimensions; room labels (as applicable).
- **Floor plan** must include: interior walls; doorways; staircases; exterior ingress/egress; room labels; exterior wall dimensions.
- See 5605.5(c) for unusual floor plans.

#### (A) ANSI Z765 (Square Footage) — when required
Use the **current ANSI Standard** as of the appraisal effective date or PDR date. Summary:

| Property / Form | Inspection / Data Collection | Building Sketch & Measurement | Floor Plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1-unit (incl. PUD, ADU; detached condo ok)** – **Form 70** | Interior/Exterior | **Sketch required; ANSI required**³ | Required when **atypical**¹ |
| **1-unit** – **Form 70D (Desktop)** | None | **Sketch required; ANSI not required** | **Required** |
| **1-unit (Hybrid)** – **Form 70H** | Physical data collection with **PDR** | **Sketch required; ANSI required**³ | Required when **atypical**¹ |
| **1-unit Exterior-only** – **Form 2055** | Exterior | **Sketch not required** | Required when **atypical**¹ |
| **Condo (attached & detached)** – **Form 465** | Interior/Exterior | **Sketch required; ANSI required for detached only**² ³ | Required when **atypical**¹ |
| **Condo (Hybrid)** – **Form 465H** | Physical data collection with **PDR** | **Sketch required; ANSI required**³ | Required when **atypical**¹ |
| **Condo Exterior-only** – **Form 466** | Exterior | **Sketch not required** | Required when **atypical**¹ |
| **Manufactured Home** – **Form 70B** | Interior/Exterior | **Sketch required; ANSI required**³ | Required when **atypical**¹ |
| **2–4 units (incl. 2–3 w/ ADU)** – **Form 72** | Interior/Exterior | **Sketch required**; include **sq ft per unit** & **gross building area**; **ANSI not required**² | **Floor plan required for each unit** |
| **Co-op** – **FNMA 2090** | Interior/Exterior | **Sketch required; ANSI required**² ³ | Required when **atypical**¹ |
| **Form 442 (Update/Completion)** | As assignment requires | **Not required** | **Not required** |

¹ Required when atypical/functionally obsolete vs. market.  
² ANSI not required for condo/co-op in garden/mid-/high-rise or apartment/multifamily; appraiser may use plat/project exhibits/floor plans.  
³ If sketching/3D scanning software is used, the output must also conform to ANSI.

#### (B) Measurement terminology & where to report (ANSI)
- **Finished area (above-grade)**: used for GLA; rooms count in above-grade room count; report in all GLA fields (Improvements, Sales Comparison grid, Cost Approach).
- **NSFA (Non-standard finished area)**: finished above-grade that doesn’t meet ANSI (e.g., max ceiling height 6').  
  - Report **“NSFA”** on the **first blank line** of the Sales Comparison grid (FEATURE column shows **NSFA**).  
  - Rooms in NSFA count in room counts per UAD (as applicable).  
- **Below-grade (finished/unfinished)**: Any level with any portion below grade is **below grade**; report on **Basement & Finished Rooms Below Grade** lines of the grid.  
- **Above-grade unfinished area**: Report in **Additional Features** and adjust in grid as appropriate; measure separately from primary dwelling areas (except attached ADU, which follows ANSI).  
- **ADUs**: Measure finished/unfinished per ANSI; **detached structures** not part of Primary Residence are **not** measured by ANSI.

> *Note: These ANSI reporting placements do **not** apply to PDRs.*

#### (C) ANSI adherence — departure
If ANSI adherence isn’t possible, appraisal must include:
- The identifier **“GXX001-”** at the beginning of **Additional Features**,
- Explanation of non-adherence, and
- An **ANSI-prescribed departure declaration** (e.g., no interior access; proposed based on plans; unable to directly measure).

### (iii) Location map
Must show subject and all comps (closed sales/rentals, active listings) as applicable.
