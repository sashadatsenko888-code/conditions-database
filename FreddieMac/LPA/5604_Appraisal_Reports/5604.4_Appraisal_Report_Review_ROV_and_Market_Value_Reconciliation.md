## Overview
This section outlines the **review and reconsideration processes for appraisal reports**, including requirements for:

- Obtaining subsequent appraisal or review reports  
- Reconciling multiple market value opinions  
- Documentation and delivery requirements

## (a) Appraisal Report Review Requirements

### (i) Seller Responsibility
The Seller must evaluate each appraisal report to determine whether:
- It meets all Freddie Mac and Purchase Document requirements  
- The opinion of market value is **credible and adequately supported**  

The Seller must also ensure that **valuation staff and third parties** (e.g., AMCs, fee appraisers, reviewers, underwriters):
- Are trained to recognize **discriminatory practices** and **appraisal deficiencies**  
- Can identify **unacceptable appraisal practices** as defined in Section 5603.4  
- Follow a documented remediation process to correct identified deficiencies  

---

### (ii) Deficiency Remediation and Appraisal Report Rejection
Before rejecting an appraisal report, the Seller must:
1. Request that the appraiser **provide additional information or corrections**.  
2. If the appraiser does not adequately address the issues and the report fails to meet Freddie Mac standards,  
   → the appraisal report must be **rejected**, and a **new appraisal report** obtained.

---

## (b) Reconsideration of Value (ROV) Requirements

Sellers must maintain written **policies and procedures** governing Borrower-initiated ROVs that comply with:
- Freddie Mac minimum standards  
- All applicable **local, State, and federal laws**  

> If State law provides stronger borrower protections, **State law prevails**.

### Key ROV Policy Elements
1. **Disclosure to Borrower**
   - Provide written notice explaining the ROV process at the time the appraisal report is delivered.  
   - Include clear instructions for submitting an ROV request.  

2. **Appraisal Review Before ROV**
   - The Seller must **complete its internal review** of the appraisal before starting the ROV process.

3. **Standardized ROV Submission Format**
   Each ROV submission must include:
   - Borrower’s name, property address, appraisal effective date, appraiser’s name, and ROV submission date  
   - Identification of **specific issues or deficiencies** in the appraisal  
   - Up to **five alternative comparable properties**, with sources (e.g., MLS or public data) and rationale for inclusion  
   - Any additional **information or data** supporting the request  

4. **ROV Processing Requirements**
   - Verify the ROV request is **complete and detailed enough** to justify re-engagement of the appraiser.  
   - If unclear or incomplete, the Seller must work with the Borrower to remedy deficiencies.  
   - Instruct the appraiser to provide a **revised appraisal report** that:
     - Addresses the ROV issues, and  
     - Includes commentary even if the appraiser concludes **no changes** are warranted.  
   - Define **turn-time expectations** for communicating ROV results to Borrowers.  
   - Limit to **one Borrower-initiated ROV** per appraisal.  
   - Retain all ROV documentation in the **Mortgage file**.  
   - Once a loan is **closed**, no new ROV requests are permitted.  

5. **Regulatory and Reporting Obligations**
   - ROV policies must **not conflict** with **Exhibit 35, Appraiser Independence Requirements**.  
   - If **material deficiencies or unacceptable appraisal practices** (Section 5603.4) are found and not corrected:  
     - Forward the appraisal and findings to the **appropriate appraisal licensing or regulatory agency**.  
   - If **discriminatory or illegal practices** are suspected:  
     - Report to the relevant **local, State, or federal agency**.  
   - In such cases, the Seller may obtain a **second or subsequent appraisal** as permitted by Freddie Mac and law.

## (c) Obtaining Subsequent Appraisal, Desk Review, or Field Review Reports

Per **Exhibit 35**, the Seller must **not order or use a subsequent appraisal** unless one of the following applies:

1. There are **documented indicators** that the original appraisal was inaccurate, not credible, or violated professional or nondiscrimination standards.  
2. The second appraisal is conducted under a **bona fide pre- or post-funding review process** or written quality control policy,  
   and the Seller consistently selects the **most reliable appraisal**, not the highest value.  
3. The subsequent appraisal is **required by law**.

---

## (d) Reconciling Multiple Opinions of Market Value
When multiple opinions of market value exist (e.g., original, desk review, or field review):
- If the initial appraisal was **not rejected**, and  
- The subsequent report was obtained in compliance with Freddie Mac and Purchase Document requirements,  
→ The Seller must use the **most credible opinion of market value** for underwriting.

---

## (e) Mortgage File Documentation and Delivery Data
The Seller must retain in the **Mortgage file**:
- All documents used in the valuation analysis  
- Written justification for which appraisal (or review) was relied upon for underwriting  

The **value used to underwrite** the Mortgage:
- Becomes the basis for the Seller’s **value warranty**  
- Must be reported to Freddie Mac in **delivery data**  
- If eligible for submission via the **Uniform Collateral Data Portal® (UCDP®)**,  
  the appraisal must be uploaded and receive a **“Successful” status** before delivery  

> See Section 5606.2 for additional UCDP requirements.
