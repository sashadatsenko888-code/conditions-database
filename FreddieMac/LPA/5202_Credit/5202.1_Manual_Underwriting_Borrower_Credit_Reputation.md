Section: 5202.1 - Manually Underwritten Mortgages — Borrower Credit Reputation  
Effective Date: 08/06/2025  

Manually Underwritten Mortgages must meet the requirements of this chapter and the Guide.

---

Condition #1:  
Establishing Borrower’s credit reputation.  
To establish an acceptable credit reputation, there must be at least a minimum amount of credit history. A short credit history may be sufficient but adds risk that must be considered.

(i) Minimum number of payment references.  
At least one Borrower whose income or assets are used to qualify must have **either**:  
- At least **three Tradelines** (on or off the credit report), **or**  
- At least **four Noncredit Payment References**, **or** a **total of four** combined Tradelines and Noncredit Payment References.

Authorized user Tradelines may count **only if** the file documents one of:  
- The account is owned by another Borrower on the Mortgage; or  
- The account is owned by the Borrower’s spouse; or  
- The Borrower has made the payments for the last 12 months and the reported monthly payment is included in DTI.

Resident alien Borrowers who meet the U.S. minimum payment references may supplement with foreign credit history. Foreign documentation must meet:  
- Section 5102.3 (verification documents)  
- Section 5102.4 (age of documentation)  
- Section 5203.1 (credit reports)

(ii) Noncredit Payment References.  
- Each Noncredit Payment Reference must have existed **≥ 12 months**.  
- Using only Noncredit Payment References adds risk and, if **all Borrowers** are established only with Noncredit Payment References, **at least one Borrower** must complete **homeownership education** before the Note Date/Effective Date of Permanent Financing (see Section 5103.4).  
- When housing payment history exists, verify **current and prior** housing payment histories for **≥ 12 months** (or the available length if less), per Section 5202.1(b).  
- Voluntary deposits (e.g., savings plan, payroll savings, stock purchase plan) with **≥ 12 months** of periodic deposits (≥ quarterly) that increase balances may count as a Noncredit Payment Reference.

---

Condition #2:  
Documenting Borrower’s credit reputation.

(i) Required documentation.  
The file must clearly show the Borrower met obligations over time. Include:  
- Form 65, Uniform Residential Loan Application.  
- Credit reports.  
- For **Caution** Mortgages, the Feedback Certificate.  
- Any **direct verifications** of payment histories.  
- An underwriting summary (e.g., **Form 1077**).  
- Any additional documentation needed based on the history.

If the credit report omits any significant open debt (including housing) listed on the application, obtain separate **written verification**. Accounts marked “will rate by mail only” or “need written authorization” also require separate verification.

On **Form 1077** (or other document), the file must describe:  
- Additional risks found during evaluation; and  
- The analysis and conclusion that the Borrower’s credit reputation is acceptable.

Documents used to establish history must be **consistent with each other** and the application. Include support for any derogatory information or risks identified.

When underwriting with Credit Scores, identify on **Form 1077**:  
- The Credit Score selected for each Borrower;  
- How it was selected; and  
- Explanations for any unusable scores.

(ii) Documentation of Tradelines and Noncredit Payment References.

(A) Direct verification.  
A direct verification may be a completed form or creditor-generated history obtained **directly** by the Seller and signed by the verifier. It must show:  
- Creditor name/address and phone;  
- Payor name;  
- Verifier name/title;  
- Account number (if applicable);  
- Nature of obligation;  
- Highest credit (if applicable);  
- Payment amount due;  
- Outstanding balance;  
- Current and historical status with explicit late count format (e.g., **“0×30, 0×60, 0×90”**).  
- For housing history shorter than 12 months, the age of the reference.  
General reference letters without these details are **not sufficient**.

(B) Other acceptable documentation.  
In lieu of direct verification, the Seller may obtain:  
- **Canceled checks**, **receipts** (see 5202.1(c) requirements), **third-party money transfer** records, or **depository statements**.  
Also include documentation establishing **terms of repayment** (e.g., fully executed **lease** for rental verification).

Such documentation must show: creditor/payor names, nature of obligation, highest balance (if applicable), payment due, outstanding balance, current/historical status with number/days past due, and (for housing <12 months) the age of the reference.

Voluntary savings history used as a Noncredit Payment Reference must meet **Section 5501.3(a)** asset documentation.

**Rental verification** requires:  
- Copy of fully executed **lease**, and  
- Canceled checks/depository statements/third-party app records/receipts per this chapter, and  
- Confirmation of **timely payments** for the most recent **12 months**.

(C) Requirements for receipts.  
Receipts are acceptable **only** when payments were made **in cash** and there is no evidence of checks or direct transfers.

Condition #3:  
Evaluating Borrower’s credit reputation.  
Evaluate by one of the following:

- **With usable Credit Scores**: Manually underwrite using FICO® scores and reason codes; analyze each credit report and verifications. If a **minimum Indicator Score** is required, it must be met.  
- **Without usable Credit Scores**: Manually underwrite without FICO; analyze all reports and verifications.

(i) Determining whether Credit Scores are usable.

(A) **Insufficient information.**  
Do **not** use any FICO score based on **fewer than three Tradelines**.  
Ask the CRC to indicate how many Tradelines were used for each score, or obtain the in-file report used to create each score.

(B) **Inaccurate information.**  
Disregard a FICO score if based on **significant inaccuracies** (e.g., bankruptcy/foreclosure/judgment/collection not belonging to Borrower; erroneous delinquencies; Tradelines not belonging to Borrower; authorized user accounts unless documented as above).  
Minor balance/payment discrepancies are **not** significant.  
Document decisions on **Form 1077**.  
Do **not** “adjust” a FICO value; you may obtain a different score from another CRA not affected by the same inaccuracies.  
For each Mortgage where significant inaccuracies were found, include **written documentation** from the CRA or furnishing creditor affirming the errors. Encourage Borrower to exercise FCRA rights. (Authorized user accounts excluded from this requirement.)

(ii) Underwriting with usable Credit Scores.

(A) **Underwriting Score (per Borrower).**  
Select a single FICO for each qualifying Borrower using the **middle/lower method**:

| Usable FICO scores | Underwriting Score is… |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | The **middle** value |
| 2 | The **lower** of the two |
| 1 | That **one** score |

Example: 660, 656, 640 → **656**. Duplicate scores → use that score.

(B) **Indicator Score (for the Mortgage).**  
Identify and deliver an Indicator Score using **one** method below (Freddie Mac recommends **Middle/Lower then Lowest**):

| Method | Indicator Score is… |
| --- | --- |
| Middle/Lower then Lowest | The **lowest** Underwriting Score |
| Middle/Lower then Average | The **average** of all Underwriting Scores |
| Average/Average | The **average** of Borrower-level averages of usable FICOs |

- Minimum Indicator Score requirements appear in product/offering chapters and **Exhibit 25** and must be met, if applicable.  
- If **no Borrower** has a usable FICO and an Indicator Score is required, the Mortgage is **not eligible**.  
- An Indicator Score **does not by itself** establish acceptable credit reputation; each Borrower must still be acceptable individually and collectively.

(C) **Additional requirements for Borrowers with usable Credit Scores.**  
Use **reason codes** to identify credit factors needing offsets. Do **not** use as offsets factors already considered in FICO creation, such as: absence/age of derogatories; proportion paid as agreed; types of accounts; recent pay-downs/consolidations; length of history; or combinations thereof.

(iii) Borrowers **without** usable Credit Scores.  
Manual underwriting may be used when the Mortgage is:  
- A **purchase** or **no cash-out** refinance;  
- Secured by a **1–4 unit Primary Residence**; and  
- **Not** a super conforming Mortgage.

(iv) Additional evaluation requirements.  
Acceptable credit reputation = a history evidencing willingness and ability to meet obligations.  
- Each Borrower must be acceptable individually; strong credit of one cannot offset another’s unacceptable credit.  
- Review **all** credit documentation for accuracy/consistency; thoroughly evaluate entire history (exclude **trended** data).  
- Consider reason codes, significant derogatories (see 5202.1(d)), overall **layering of risk** (see 5102.2(b)), and document the conclusion on **Form 1077**.

Weigh: types/amounts of credit, length of history, use of credit (balances-to-limits), recent new accounts/amount outstanding, payment history/status, inquiries, and public records/collections.  
Give **more weight** to **Tradelines** than Noncredit Payment References; and **more weight** to **housing** than non-housing payments (but do not ignore other derogatories).  
A stronger credit reputation may be required when capacity or collateral is weak.

Condition #4:  
Adverse or derogatory credit information.

- Significant derogatory information within the **most recent two years** → credit reputation **not acceptable**.  
- Otherwise, document **extenuating circumstances** or conclude **financial mismanagement**.

(i) Establishing significance.  
Always significant if any of the following:  
- Underwritten with FICO and **≥ 2** reason codes relate to nonpayment.  
- Several accounts with **recent lates**.  
- **Multiple 60- or 90-day** lates.  
- **>1** 30-day late **housing** payment in last 12 months.  
- **>2** 30-day or **>1** 60-day late housing payments in the most recent two years.  
- Number/size of delinquent accounts large vs. overall credit.  
- Multiple episodes of lates over time.  
- Recent derogatories plus multiple revolving accounts with **high balances-to-limits**.  
- Several public record derogatories (judgments, tax liens, non-medical collections).  
- Bankruptcy/foreclosure/deed-in-lieu/short sale within **7 years**.

Isolated, non-recent 30-day lates with otherwise good credit and no high utilization generally **not significant**. Timeshare loans are **installment** debts; housing-late rules and foreclosure recovery periods do **not** apply to timeshare foreclosures.

(A) **Extenuating circumstances.**  
If significant derogatory credit exists in the last **2 years**, the credit reputation **cannot** be acceptable even with extenuating circumstances.  
Otherwise, to justify acceptability despite significant derogatory info caused by extenuating circumstances, include:  
- Borrower’s signed statement (letter or e-mail) explaining outside, nonrecurring factors;  
- Third-party documentation confirming the events and impact;  
- Underwriting analysis (Form 1077 or similar) connecting the facts to a reasonable conclusion that events were beyond control, not ongoing/unlikely to recur, and credit has been reestablished;  
- Evidence of time since derogatory event (recovery period).

**Reestablishment requirements (Extenuating Circumstances):**

| Significant derogatory event | Recovery time period | Additional requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Foreclosure** | 36 months from completion **or** (if mortgage extinguished in Ch.7) use Ch.7 recovery from discharge date, provided foreclosure began **after** filing and mortgage was **not** reaffirmed | If prior foreclosure: purchase primary residence ≤ **90%** LTV/TLTV/HTLTV (or product max), **or** no-cash-out refi per Ch. 4301; include evidence of completion |
| **Deed-in-lieu** | 24 months from execution | Same LTV/refi rules as above; include evidence of deed-in-lieu |
| **Short sale** | 24 months from completion | Same LTV/refi rules as above; include evidence of short sale |
| **Bankruptcy (all)** | 24 months from discharge/dismissal | Include petition, schedules, discharge/dismissal; evidence debts paid/being paid; support reestablished credit |
| **Other significant derogatory** | 24 months from most recent | N/A |

(B) **Financial mismanagement.**  
If extenuating circumstances cannot be documented, conclude **financial mismanagement**. Overcoming this requires **longer** and more convincing reestablishment. Include:  
- Evidence of reestablished acceptable credit (per Topics 5100 and 5200).  
- Borrower’s signed explanation.  
- Underwriting analysis (Form 1077 or similar) concluding issues unlikely to recur and credit reestablished.  
- Evidence of time since derogatory event.

**Reestablishment requirements (Financial Mismanagement):**

| Significant derogatory event | Recovery time period | Additional requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Foreclosure** | **84 months** from completion **or** (if mortgage extinguished in Ch.7) use Ch.7 recovery from discharge date (same conditions as above) | N/A |
| **Deed-in-lieu** | **48 months** from execution | If within last 7 years: purchase primary residence ≤ **90%** LTV/TLTV/HTLTV (or product max) **or** no-cash-out refi; include evidence of completion |
| **Short sale** | **48 months** from completion | Same as above; include evidence of completion |
| **Bankruptcy Ch.7/11** | **48 months** from discharge/dismissal | Provide petition, schedules, discharge/dismissal; evidence debts paid/being paid; other support |
| **Bankruptcy Ch.12/13** | **24 months** after discharge **or** **48 months** from dismissal | Same documentation as above |
| **Multiple bankruptcies (past 7 years)** | **60 months** from most recent discharge/dismissal | Same documentation as above |
| **Other significant derogatory** | **48 months** from most recent | N/A |

(ii) Documenting Borrower explanation of adverse/derogatory info.  
- Written explanation (signed letter or e-mail) is **required** for significant derogatory info.  
- For non-significant derogatory info, request explanation at Seller’s discretion.  
- Assistance in drafting is allowed; Borrower must attest to accuracy.  
- Seller must relate the explanation to the full file and reasonably conclude the Borrower is an acceptable credit risk.

Condition #5:  
Evaluating other credit information.

(i) **Inquiries.**  
If inquiries within last **90 days**, determine if new credit was granted. If yes:  
- Obtain verification; and  
- Include the monthly payment in **DTI** per Section 5401.2.  
Consider the number/timing of inquiries, especially with short history and high utilization.

(ii) **Age of accounts.**  
Review for recent significant increases in open accounts. Multiple recent new accounts may indicate overextension and require conservatism. Consider payment history, outstanding credit, revolving utilization, and recent inquiries.

(iii) **Balances-to-limits / high revolving utilization.**  
- Compare balances to limits; **multiple** revolving accounts > **50%** of limit increase risk.  
- Overall revolving utilization > **60%** is a risk factor.  
- High balances and utilization, especially with new accounts, can indicate overextension.  
- Lack of derogatories **cannot** offset high utilization.  
- Determine whether utilization layered with other risks makes credit reputation unacceptable.

---

Condition #6:  
Documenting and delivering Underwriting Scores and Indicator Scores.

(i) **Documenting**.  
When a minimum Indicator Score is required, note on **Form 1077** (or similar):  
- Each Borrower’s **Underwriting Score**;  
- The **Indicator Score**; and  
- **How** each was identified.  
Retain source documentation.

(ii) **Delivering**.  
Deliver in ULDD:  
- **Loan Level Credit Score Value** (Indicator Score), and  
- **Loan Level Credit Score Selection Method Type**:  
  - “Middle Or Lower Then Lowest”  
  - “Middle or Lower Then Average”  
  - “Average Then Average”  

If no usable Indicator Score due to **insufficient credit**, select ULDD **Credit Score Impairment Type** = “Insufficient Credit History”.  
If no usable Indicator Score due to **significant inaccuracies**, select “Significant Errors Score”.
