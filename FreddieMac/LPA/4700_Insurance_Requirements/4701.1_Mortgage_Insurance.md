## Overview  

Section 4701.1 outlines Freddie Mac’s **mortgage insurance (MI) requirements** for conventional Mortgages with **loan-to-value (LTV) ratios greater than 80%**. It establishes the coverage levels, policy standards, and eligibility conditions for both **standard** and **custom** MI options.

---

## Core Requirements  

### (a) When Mortgage Insurance Is Required  
- MI is **required** for all **conventional Mortgages purchased by Freddie Mac** with an **LTV ratio > 80%**.  
- LTV is calculated by dividing the **original loan amount** by the **value** as defined in §4203.1(a).  

---

### (b) Freddie Mac’s Mortgage Insurance Coverage Options  

Freddie Mac offers two MI coverage options:  

1. **Standard Mortgage Insurance** – default coverage levels.  
2. **Custom Mortgage Insurance** – alternative lower coverage, available only for Accept Mortgages and subject to a Credit Fee in Price.  

#### Standard vs. Custom Coverage Levels

| Transaction Type | Term | LTV >80% & ≤85% | LTV >85% & ≤90% | LTV >90% & ≤95% | LTV >95% & ≤97% |
|------------------|------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Fixed-rate ≤20 yrs | Standard: 6% | 12% | 25% | 35% |
| | Custom: N/A | N/A | 16% | 18% |
| Fixed-rate >20 yrs / ARMs¹ / Manufactured Homes¹ | Standard: 12% | 25% | 30% | 35% |
| | Custom: 6% | 12% | 16% | 18% |
| **Home Possible®** (fixed ≤20 yrs) | Standard: 6% | 12% | 25% | 25% |
| | Custom: N/A | N/A | 16% | 18% |
| **Home Possible®** (fixed >20 yrs, ARMs¹, Manufactured Homes¹) | Standard: 12% | 25% | 25% | 25% |
| | Custom: 6% | 12% | 16% | 18% |

¹ *Except for CHOICEHome® Mortgages per §5703.12, ARMs and Manufactured Homes are limited to a maximum LTV of 95%.*  

**Note:**  
- If **custom MI** is selected, the **Custom MI Credit Fee in Price** from **Exhibit 19** applies.  
- This includes Home Possible® Mortgages.  

---

### (c) Custom Mortgage Insurance Options  

- Available **only for Accept Mortgages** (must receive an “Accept” risk class).  
- **Cannot be financed** as part of the loan’s principal amount.  
- Subject to the **Custom MI Credit Fee in Price** (Exhibit 19).  

---

### (d) Mortgaged Premises in the State of New York  

For Mortgaged Premises located in **New York State**:  
- The “value” used to determine MI requirements or cancellation is the **appraised value on the Note Date**, solely for MI purposes.  
- This definition is **not used** for any other LTV-based calculation under the Purchase Documents.  
- For **Cooperative Share Loans** in New York, see §4701.5 for additional MI guidance.  

---

### (e) MI Master Policy Requirements  

- MI must be issued by a **Freddie Mac-approved Mortgage Insurer** (see **Exhibit 10**).  
- Coverage must:  
  - Be **effective by the Delivery Date** and **remain in force** until canceled in accordance with §§8203.2–8203.4(c) or applicable law.  
  - Not include **exclusions** beyond those in the MI’s **master policy**.  
  - Run **to the benefit of Freddie Mac** for whole or participation loans.  
- **Participation policies** inconsistent with these terms, or imposing premium or reporting obligations on Freddie Mac, are **unacceptable**.  
- The Seller must ensure that no actions impair Freddie Mac’s rights under the policy.  

#### Borrower Disclosure  
The Seller warrants that the Borrower received all required **Homeowners Protection Act (HPA)** disclosures, including:  
- Origination-time disclosure of MI cancellation rights;  
- Ongoing HPA-related disclosures as applicable.  

---

### (f) Credit Fees  

- If MI coverage deviates from standard levels (i.e., Custom MI), Freddie Mac charges the **Custom Mortgage Insurance Option Credit Fee in Price**, as defined in **Exhibit 19**.
