## Overview  

Section 4702.4 establishes **Freddie Mac’s exclusive list of acceptable title exceptions** that may appear in a **title insurance policy** or **attorney opinion of title letter**.  
These exceptions are permitted **only** when they do not adversely affect lien priority, property use, marketability, or value.  

Any exception **not listed or meeting the below criteria** renders the Mortgage **ineligible for purchase**.
