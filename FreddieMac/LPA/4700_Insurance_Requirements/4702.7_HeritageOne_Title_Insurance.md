## Overview  

Section 4702.7 defines Freddie Mac’s **special title insurance requirements for HeritageOne® Mortgages**, which are designed for loans secured by properties located on **tribal trust land, allotted trust land, or fee simple land** held by **Eligible Native American Tribes**.  

This section modifies certain general rules in Chapter 4702 to account for the **unique title recording and sovereignty structures** of tribal jurisdictions.

## Core Requirements  

### (a) Land Ownership Type and Title Requirements  

| Land Type | Title Insurance Requirement | Key Exceptions |
|------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| **Tribal Trust Land or Allotted Trust Land** | **Title insurance is *not required*** for leasehold HeritageOne® Mortgages (including Condominiums and Manufactured Homes) **if all below are met:**<br>1.

### (b) Key Provisions  

- The **certified Title Status Report (TSR)** functions as the equivalent of a title policy for tribal or allotted trust land.  
- The TSR must **confirm the legal ownership and encumbrance status** of the trust/allotted land, as maintained by the BIA and any applicable tribal registry.  
- **Fee simple lands**, even within tribal jurisdictions, are subject to **full title insurance coverage** under standard Freddie Mac rules — **with no tribal law exclusions.**  
- **HeritageOne Mortgages** follow **additional program-level rules** found in **Chapter 4504** of the Freddie Mac Guide (Native American lending eligibility, leasehold requirements, and borrower protections).
