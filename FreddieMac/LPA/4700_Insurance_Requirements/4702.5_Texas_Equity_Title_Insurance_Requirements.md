- Must include the **optional coverage in paragraph 2(f)**.  
- **No exceptions, deletions, or alterations** are permitted to paragraphs **2(a) through 2(e)**.

#### 2. **Supplemental Coverage Equity Loan Mortgage Endorsement (Form T-42.1)**  

- Required for all eligible transactions.  
- Must include all coverage in **paragraphs 1(a)–1(k)** and **any subparagraphs added by later TDI-approved revisions**.  
- **No deletions or exceptions** are permitted.  
- This endorsement provides extended coverage against procedural defects, unauthorized advances, and constitutional compliance issues.  

#### 3. **Additional State-Approved Endorsements**  

- If the **Texas Department of Insurance** later approves an endorsement offering **additional mortgagee protections**, it must be obtained for all new loans originated **on or after** its effective date.
