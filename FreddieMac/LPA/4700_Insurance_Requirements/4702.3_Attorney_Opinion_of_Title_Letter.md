   - Covers malpractice in issuing title opinions.  
   - Has a **per-claim limit not less than the Mortgage’s UPB**.  
   - Extends coverage to **assignees, successors**, and the **law firm or organization** issuing the letter (even if the attorney later departs).  
   - Provides **proof of active coverage** at delivery.

#### Required Legal Assertions  

The letter must:

- Confirm the **title condition is acceptable** and that the Mortgage is a **lien of required priority** on a **fee simple estate**.  
- List all subordinate liens.  
- State that the **attorney and firm meet the issuer qualifications** above.
