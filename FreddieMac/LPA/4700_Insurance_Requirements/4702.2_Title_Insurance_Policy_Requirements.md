## Overview  

Section 4702.2 defines the **minimum requirements for title insurance policies** on all Mortgages delivered to Freddie Mac.  
It establishes standards for the **title insurer, coverage amount, policy form, endorsements, surveys, and permitted exceptions**, ensuring that Freddie Mac receives enforceable, first-lien protection against title defects.

---

## Core Requirements  

### (a) Title Insurer  

- The policy must be issued by a **title insurer legally authorized** to operate in the property’s jurisdiction.  
- The policy must be **fully enforceable** and protective of the mortgagee’s rights.  
- If a **preliminary binder or commitment** is issued, it must be from the **same insurer** issuing the final policy.  
- The **Seller’s selection** of the insurer must be based solely on:  
  - The **comprehensiveness** of coverage  
  - The insurer’s **financial strength and claim history**  
  - **Institutional standards** in the market  
- The Seller may **not receive compensation or consideration** (direct or indirect) for insurer selection.

---

### (b) Amount of Protection  

- The policy must protect the mortgagee for **at least the current principal balance** of the Mortgage.

---

### (c) Insured Mortgage  

- Coverage must run to **Freddie Mac** for fully purchased loans.  
- For **MERS-registered Mortgages**, the policy must:  
  - Identify the Security Instrument as given to MERS **solely as nominee for Lender and successors**.  
  - Never name **MERS** as an insured.  
  - Ensure all **insurance drafts, policies, and communications** are sent directly to the Seller/Servicer — not to the MERS address.

- Policy form must be **permitted by State law**.  
- If a non-ALTA form is used, Seller must **warrant equal or broader coverage** than the applicable ALTA policy.  
- Required **endorsements** must match the **policy year** and include, as applicable:  
  - ALTA **8.1** – Environmental Protection Lien  
  - ALTA **6 / 6.1 / 6.2** – Variable Rate Mortgage (ARMs)

  - ALTA **9** – Restrictive Covenants (per §4702.4(d))  
  - ALTA **47.1** – Operative Law (tribal jurisdiction overlap, exclusions removed)  

#### Master Title Insurance Policies  

A Seller may rely on a **master title insurance policy** if:  
- The Seller reviews the insurer’s master policy documents and verifies:  
  - Coverage equals or exceeds ALTA scope and amount  
  - The master policy meets all §4702.2 requirements  
- The Seller obtains a **fully executed master policy** issued in its name and assigns rights to Freddie Mac.  
- The policy is **State-approved**, and  
- The insurer agrees to issue an **individual ALTA policy within 10 days’ notice** if Freddie Mac requests.  

> Freddie Mac reserves the right to reject any master title insurance program.

---

### (e) Survey Requirements  

- If a survey is required by the title insurer or attorney to remove exceptions, the Seller must obtain a **survey** meeting:  
  - The title company’s or attorney’s **standards**, and  
  - **Applicable legal requirements**.  

---

### (f) Exceptions to Survey Matters  

- Title policies may not include **survey exceptions** unless permitted by §4702.4.  
- If exceptions exist, the Seller must supply required information to remove or insure over them.  
- Freddie Mac will **not purchase** a Mortgage if:  
  - The title company insists on a **survey exception**, or  
  - The policy contains unapproved **title exceptions**.
