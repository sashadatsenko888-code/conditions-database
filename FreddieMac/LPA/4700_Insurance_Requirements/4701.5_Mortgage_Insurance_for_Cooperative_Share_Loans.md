> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  

Section 4701.5 provides an exception to Freddie Mac’s general mortgage insurance (MI) requirements under §4701.1, specifically addressing **Cooperative Share Loans** secured by **New York properties**.  

The rule clarifies when the **sales price of the Cooperative Interest** may be used in determining MI requirements for **purchase transactions**, and reaffirms that §4701.1 governs all subsequent MI-related calculations and cancellations.

## Core Requirements  

### (a) Exception for New York Cooperative Share Loans  

For **purchase transactions** involving **Cooperative Share Loans** in the **State of New York**:  

- The **sales price of the Cooperative Interest** (rather than the appraised value) **may be used solely** to determine **whether mortgage insurance is required**.  
- This exception applies **only for the purpose of MI requirement determination**, not for general LTV calculation or other underwriting metrics.  

---

### (b) Standard Coverage Application  

If MI is determined to be **required** based on the Cooperative Interest sales price, then:  

- The **loan-to-value (LTV) ratio** used to calculate the **required MI coverage percentage** must follow the standards in **§4701.1**.  
- The same LTV calculation under §4701.1 also governs whether and when MI **may be canceled** under Freddie Mac’s policy or applicable law.
