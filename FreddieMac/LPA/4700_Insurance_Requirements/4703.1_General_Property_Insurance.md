Section: 4703.1 – General Property Insurance Requirements  
Effective Date: 07/09/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  

Section 4703.1 establishes **minimum property insurance standards** for Mortgaged Premises securing loans sold to Freddie Mac.  
The Seller must ensure that every property is **continuously insured** by a licensed, financially sound insurer, and must **retain evidence of coverage** that meets **Section 8202.4** documentation requirements.

---

## Core Requirements  

### (a) Licensing of Insurer  

- The **insurance company** (and any **reinsurer**) must be **licensed or otherwise authorized by law** to conduct business **in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Premises is located**.  
- Unauthorized or unlicensed entities are not acceptable, except as allowed under subsection (c) for certain non-admitted carriers meeting high financial strength criteria.

---

### (b) Assessments  

- Insurance contracts must explicitly state that:  
  1. **No assessment may be made** against **the Seller/Servicer or Freddie Mac**; and  
  2. **Any assessment against others** (e.g., property owners’ associations) **must not become a lien** on the Mortgaged Premises **superior to Freddie Mac’s lien**.  

This prevents HOA, insurer, or mutual insurer assessments from compromising Freddie Mac’s lien priority.

---

### (c) Rating and Acceptability of Insurer  

Freddie Mac defines **five acceptable categories** of insurers and reinsurers:

| Category | Rating / Requirement | Acceptable Minimum Ratings | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| **1. Licensed Admitted Insurer** | Must meet rating thresholds by one of the listed agencies. | • AM Best: **B+**<br>• Demotech: **A**<br>• S&P Global: **BBB**<br>• Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA): **BBB** | Must be licensed to operate in the property’s state. |
| **2. Reinsured Coverage** | Policy guaranteed by reinsurer meeting rating thresholds. | • AM Best: **B+**<br>• S&P: **BBB** | Reinsurer must assume **100% of liability** by endorsement and provide **90-day written cancellation notice** to policyholder, Seller/Servicer, and insurer. |
| **3. State Insurance Pool / FAIR Plan** | Created by statutory authority for underserved areas or insurance lines. | N/A | Acceptable for properties in areas with limited market availability. |
| **4. Non-Admitted (Surplus Lines) Insurer** | Acceptable with stronger financial strength. | • AM Best: **A**<br>• S&P: **AA-** | Only acceptable if admitted insurers unavailable; must meet rating standard. |
| **5. NFIP-Guaranteed Coverage** | Coverage under **National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)**. | N/A | Satisfies property insurance requirement for flood per the **National Flood Insurance Act of 1968**. |

**Note:**  
If an insurer holds **multiple ratings**, meeting the standard from **any one** listed agency satisfies Freddie Mac’s requirement.
