## Core Requirements  

### Eligible Mortgage Insurance Premium Types  

Freddie Mac permits the following MI premium structures:

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Monthly premium** | Paid monthly from accumulated escrow deposits; no initial payment due at closing. |
| **Annual premium** | First year’s premium paid at closing; subsequent annual renewals paid from escrow deposits. |
| **Single-premium** | Lump-sum premium paid at closing for life-of-loan coverage. |
| **Split-premium** | Combination of an up-front payment at closing and ongoing monthly premiums from escrow deposits. |

---

### Borrower-Paid Mortgage Insurance (BPMI)

#### General Requirements  
- Borrowers may pay MI premiums via:  
  - A **single payment at closing**,  
  - **Monthly escrow deposits**, or  
  - A **combination** (split-premium).  
- Mortgages where MI is embedded in the **Note Rate** are **not eligible** for sale to Freddie Mac.

### (a) Borrower-Paid **Financed Premiums**  

A financed MI premium means the Borrower’s MI premium is **included in the loan principal**.  

#### Definitions  
- **Base LTV ratio:** Loan amount excluding financed MI premium.  
- **Gross LTV ratio:** Loan amount including financed MI premium.  

#### Eligibility Criteria  

| Condition | Requirement |
|------------|--------------|
| **Base LTV limit** | Must not exceed maximum LTV for the applicable product or offering. |
| **Gross LTV limit** | ≤ 95%; ≤ 97% for Home Possible®, HomeOne®, and HeritageOne® Mortgages. |

| **Coverage level** | Must meet standard MI coverage levels (§4701.1) based on the **Base LTV**. |
| **Payment structure** | MI premium must be a **single-premium or split-premium** payment. |

#### Financed Mortgage Insurance Premium Endorsement  
- Policy must include a **“Financed Mortgage Insurance Premium Endorsement”**.  
- Endorsement ensures MI claim calculations adjust to maintain exposure levels consistent with the **Base LTV ratio**.

#### Maximum Loan Amount  
- The **maximum original loan limits** from §4203.1(c) apply, including financed MI.  
- The **total loan amount (inclusive of MI premium)** cannot exceed Freddie Mac’s loan limits.

#### Delivery & Fees  
- Must comply with **delivery requirements in §6302.21**.  
- **Credit Fees** are assessed based on the **Gross LTV ratio** and total **UPB** (including financed MI).
