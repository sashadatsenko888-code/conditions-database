## Overview  

Section 4702.1 defines Freddie Mac’s **mandatory title insurance requirements** for all Mortgages delivered for purchase, ensuring that Freddie Mac acquires a clear, enforceable lien position.  

Unless specifically excepted by §§4702.3 or 4702.4, **every Mortgage must be covered** by a valid and compliant title insurance or equivalent guarantee.

## Core Requirements  

### (a) Mandatory Title Protection  

Each Mortgage delivered to Freddie Mac must be secured by **one** of the following forms of title evidence:

1. **A paid-up Mortgage title insurance policy** —  
   Must fully comply with the detailed requirements in **§4702.2**, including policy form, coverage, endorsements, and insurer standards.  

2. **An attorney opinion of title letter** —  
   Permitted **only if** it meets all requirements in **§4702.3**, including acceptable opinion format, scope, attorney qualifications, and reliance conditions.  

3. **A certificate of title issued by Iowa Title Guaranty** —  
   Recognized as a valid substitute for standard title insurance in Iowa, satisfying Freddie Mac’s title protection requirements.
