Section: 4702.6 – Title Insurance Requirements for Cooperative Projects and Cooperative Share Loans  
Effective Date: 04/02/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  

Section 4702.6 defines **Freddie Mac’s title insurance and lien verification requirements** for both **Cooperative Projects** and **Cooperative Share Loans**.  
The goal is to ensure that the **Cooperative Corporation and the individual Shareholder** each hold **good and marketable title** to their respective interests.

---

## Core Requirements  

### (a) Cooperative Projects  

- The **Cooperative Project** itself must be covered by a **title insurance policy** that complies with the requirements of the **Seller’s Purchase Documents**.  
- This policy protects against defects in the project’s ownership or recorded encumbrances that could impair Freddie Mac’s lien priority or enforceability.

---

### (b) Cooperative Share Loans  

The title insurance (or equivalent search evidence) depends on whether the Cooperative Share Loan is treated as **real property** or **personal property** under state law.

#### 1. When Recognized as **Real Property**

A **title insurance policy is required** and must evidence that:  
- The **Shareholder** (Borrower) holds **good and marketable title to the Cooperative Shares**; and  
- The **Cooperative Corporation** holds **good and marketable title to the Cooperative Project**.  

> This ensures that both the borrower’s ownership in the cooperative and the corporation’s title to the building are legally valid and free from superior claims.

#### 2. When Recognized as **Personal Property**

If the loan is governed by the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)** rather than real property law:  
- The Seller must **represent and warrant** that:  
  - The Shareholder has **good and marketable title** to the Cooperative Shares.  
  - The Cooperative Corporation has **good and marketable title** to the Cooperative Project.  
  - A **title lien search** (UCC or equivalent) was **completed prior to closing or delivery**.  
- A **copy of the title or lien search report must be retained** in the Mortgage file.  

> This provides evidence that no prior liens, pledges, or encumbrances exist on the cooperative shares or corporate title.
