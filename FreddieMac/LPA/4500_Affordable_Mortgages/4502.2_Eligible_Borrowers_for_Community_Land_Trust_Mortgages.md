Section: 4502.2 – Eligible Borrowers for Community Land Trust Mortgages  
Effective Date: 03/05/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section defines **Borrower eligibility requirements** for **Community Land Trust (CLT) Mortgages**.  
Because CLTs are designed to preserve **long-term affordability**, each participating homebuyer must meet specific **program eligibility standards** set by the CLT.

---

## Borrower Eligibility Requirements  

| Category | Requirement | Reference |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Program Requirements** | Borrowers must meet the **eligibility criteria established by the Community Land Trust**. | CLT Program Guidelines |
| **Verification Method** | The **completion, execution, and recordation** of the **Community Land Trust Ground Lease** serve as **confirmation** that the Borrower meets CLT eligibility requirements. | §4502.7 |

**Key Note:**  
- The CLT itself defines income limits, resale terms, and participation conditions based on its affordability mission.  
- Freddie Mac relies on the **executed ground lease** as verification — no separate documentation or eligibility certification from the CLT is required at delivery.
