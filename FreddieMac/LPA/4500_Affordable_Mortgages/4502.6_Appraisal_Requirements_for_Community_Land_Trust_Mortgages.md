Section: 4502.6 – Appraisal Requirements for Community Land Trust Mortgages  
Effective Date: 03/05/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section establishes **special appraisal standards** for **Community Land Trust (CLT) Mortgages**, in addition to general appraisal requirements.  
The goal is to ensure that the **opinion of value** reflects the leasehold interest **without resale or use restrictions**, as those restrictions are removed upon foreclosure via **Form 490, Community Land Trust Ground Lease Rider**.

---

## Appraisal Framework  

### Hypothetical Condition  
The appraiser must determine **market value** of the **leasehold interest** under the **hypothetical condition** that all resale and occupancy restrictions in the CLT Ground Lease are **removed** upon foreclosure, redemption expiration, or recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.

> **Form 490** removes such restrictions post-foreclosure, and the valuation must simulate this condition.

## Appraisal Requirements  

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Appraiser qualification** | The Seller must ensure the appraiser is **knowledgeable and experienced** in valuing leasehold properties under CLT structures. |
| **Property analysis** | The appraiser must analyze the property **subject to the CLT Ground Lease**, describing lease terms and restrictions, and reference **Form 490** explicitly. |
| **Valuation basis** | The opinion of value must be **well-supported** and correctly developed for the **leasehold interest without resale restrictions**. |
| **Appraisal form** | On the appraisal form, the appraiser must:<br>– Check “**leasehold**” as the property right appraised<br>– Report the **ground rent** owed to the CLT |
| **Comparable sales** | The appraiser should:<br>– Use **similar leasehold sales** as comparables, if available<br>– If not available, use **fee simple sales** and apply **adjustments** for market differences due to leasehold terms<br>– Avoid using sales from CLT properties affected by restricted pricing |
| **Market activity** | When leasehold sales under CLTs exist, the appraiser must **analyze and report them** but not use them as comparables if their prices were restricted. |
| **Addendum requirement** | Since standard Freddie Mac forms lack sufficient space for CLT leasehold details, an **addendum** must be attached containing:<br>– Expanded discussion of comparables<br>– “**As-is**” checked box<br>– The following required statement:  
> “**This appraisal is made based on the hypothetical condition that the property rights being appraised are the leasehold interest without resale and other restrictions that are removed by Form 490 upon foreclosure.**” |
