## Overview  
This section defines **Borrower eligibility**, **income rules**, **occupancy**, and **ownership limitations** for **HeritageOne® Mortgages**, Freddie Mac’s mortgage product for enrolled members of Native American Tribes purchasing or refinancing homes in designated Tribal Areas.

---

## (a) Eligible Borrowers  

At least **one Borrower** must:  
1. Be an **enrolled member of a Native American Tribe**, which may be a different tribe than the one governing the Tribal Area where the Mortgaged Premises is located; and  
2. **Occupy the Mortgaged Premises** as their **Primary Residence**.  

> **Note:** A Native American Tribe itself cannot be a Borrower.  

---

## (b) Borrower Income  

- HeritageOne® Borrowers are **not subject to maximum income limits**.  
- Standard Freddie Mac income documentation and stability requirements still apply (see Chapter 5301).

## (c) Occupancy Requirements  

| Property Type | Occupancy Requirement | Non-Occupying Borrowers |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1-Unit (including Manufactured Homes) | At least one Borrower must occupy the property as a Primary Residence | **Permitted** |
| 2–4 Unit | **All Borrowers must occupy** the Mortgaged Premises as their Primary Residence | **Not permitted** |

Funds used for qualification may come from both occupying and non-occupying Borrowers where applicable.  

---

## (d) Ownership of Other Property  

As of the **Note Date** (or **Effective Date of Permanent Financing** for Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages), each **occupying Borrower** must **not own more than two financed residential properties**, including the subject property.
