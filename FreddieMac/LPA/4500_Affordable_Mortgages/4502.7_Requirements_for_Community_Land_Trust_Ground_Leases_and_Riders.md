Section: 4502.7 – Requirements for Community Land Trust Ground Leases and Ground Lease Riders  
Effective Date: 10/01/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section details Freddie Mac’s requirements for **Community Land Trust (CLT) Ground Leases** and **Form 490 Ground Lease Riders**, including eligibility standards, resale formulas, lease duration, and documentation.  
It also establishes when **Freddie Mac prior written approval** is required and how **excess proceeds** must be distributed after property transfers or foreclosure.

---

## (a) Community Land Trust Ground Lease  

### (i) Ground Lease Requirements  
The Seller must review the CLT’s ground lease and confirm whether it is based on one of the following **approved model leases**:
- **National Community Land Trust Network (NCLTN) 2011 Model Ground Lease**, or  
- **Institute for Community Economics (ICE) Model Ground Lease**  

If the program is included in **Fannie Mae’s Certified Shared Equity Program list**, the Seller may deliver CLT Mortgages to Freddie Mac as follows:

| Condition | Seller Obligation |
|------------|------------------|
| Ground lease **based on approved model** | No additional review required under §4502.7(a)(ii) |
| Ground lease **not based on approved model** | Seller must confirm compliance with all additional requirements in §4502.7(a)(ii) |

The resale restrictions may be imposed by **state or local governments**, **nonprofits**, or **municipal entities** to preserve affordability.  
For every CLT Mortgage sold, the Seller **represents and warrants** that the ground lease is **valid, enforceable, and active**.

---

### (ii) Additional Ground Lease Requirements  

Each CLT Ground Lease must:
- Have a **minimum term of 30 years**  
- Include a **resale formula** that limits the homeowner’s resale proceeds and **binds future owners** until restrictions are formally removed or automatically terminate (e.g., at foreclosure or deed-in-lieu)  
- Grant the CLT a **right of first refusal** to repurchase the home at resale  
- Require the CLT to **review and approve all refinances** and **secondary financing (including HELOCs)**  
- Restrict property use primarily to **residential purposes**

---

### (iii) Freddie Mac Prior Written Approval  

Freddie Mac’s **prior written approval** is required if:
- The CLT’s lease is **not** based on either of the two model leases, **and**
- The CLT program is **not** listed on Fannie Mae’s Certified Shared Equity Program list.  

> **Exception:**  
> CLTs certified under a **Freddie Mac–approved certification program** may be exempt from Seller review and related representations/warranties, provided Freddie Mac grants written approval in advance.  
> Sellers must contact **Customer Service at 800-FREDDIE** for approval.

---

### (iv) Excess Proceeds for CLT Mortgages  

When a property under a CLT is sold:
- **By the Borrower** for an amount exceeding the restricted resale price, or  
- **By Freddie Mac** following foreclosure or deed-in-lieu  

**Excess proceeds** (amounts above total indebtedness, liens, and REO costs) are distributed as follows:

| Scenario | Distribution of Excess Proceeds |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Borrower sale above restricted price** | 1. To Borrower & CLT per ground lease equity formula<br>2. Remainder to CLT if specified in ground lease |
| **Freddie Mac REO sale** | 1. To Freddie Mac for REO expenses<br>2. Remainder to CLT if specified in ground lease |

> Servicers are **not responsible** for REO sale activities. See **Chapter 9601** for REO servicing rules.

---

## (b) Leasehold Estate Eligibility Requirements  

The leasehold estate created under the CLT Ground Lease must **constitute real property** under **applicable state law** to be eligible for Freddie Mac purchase.

---

## (c) Community Land Trust Ground Lease Rider  

Freddie Mac requires execution and recordation of **Form 490, Community Land Trust Ground Lease Rider**, along with the Ground Lease.  
Alternatively, **Fannie Mae Form 2100** may be used in lieu of Form 490, provided all Freddie Mac requirements still apply.

---

## (d) Mortgage File Requirements  

The Mortgage file must contain:
- An **original executed or certified copy** of both the **Community Land Trust Ground Lease** and **Form 490**, including **recordation information**  
- If the CLT program is part of **Fannie Mae’s Certified Shared Equity Program list**, the file must include **evidence of inclusion** as of the **Note Date**
