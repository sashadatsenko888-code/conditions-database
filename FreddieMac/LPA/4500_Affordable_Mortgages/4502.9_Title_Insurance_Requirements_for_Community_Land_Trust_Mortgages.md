Effective Date: 03/05/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section defines **title insurance requirements** for **Community Land Trust (CLT) Mortgages**, ensuring that Freddie Mac’s lien position is fully protected and that all CLT-related documents are properly recorded and insured.  

CLT Mortgages must be covered by a **title insurance policy** (or policy with endorsements) that satisfies **Chapter 4702** requirements and explicitly protects Freddie Mac’s **First Lien** interest in the leasehold estate and improvements.

## Title Insurance Coverage Requirements  

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Compliance baseline** | Title insurance must meet all applicable requirements in **Chapter 4702**. |
| **Recording verification** | The policy or an endorsement must confirm that:<br>– The **Community Land Trust Ground Lease** or **ground lease memorandum** was **recorded**.<br>– **Form 490, Community Land Trust Ground Lease Rider**, was **recorded**. |
| **Lien position** | The title insurance must ensure that the **Community Land Trust Mortgage** is a **First Lien** on both the **leasehold estate** and **improvements**. |
| **Fee estate encumbrances** | The policy must confirm **no existing mortgages, loans, or liens** on the **fee estate**, except as expressly permitted under **Form 490**. |
| **Reversionary interest subordination** | The **CLT Ground Lease reversionary interest** must be **subordinate** to the Community Land Trust Mortgage. |
| **Restriction limitations** | There must be **no active CLT occupancy or resale restrictions, covenants, or agreements** that remain valid, existing, or effective as of the policy date — except those **permitted under Form 490**. |
