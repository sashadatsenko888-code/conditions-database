> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section defines the **funding eligibility, Borrower contribution, reserves, and acceptable sources of funds** for HeritageOne® Mortgages.  
It ensures funds used in purchase or refinance transactions are legitimate, traceable, and compliant with Freddie Mac’s affordability and tribal finance requirements.

---

## (a) Borrower Contribution  

For **purchase transactions**, the minimum Borrower contribution from **Borrower personal funds** (see §4504.7(c)(i)) depends on the **LTV/TLTV ratio** and property type:

| Property / Mortgage Type | LTV/TLTV ≤ 80% | LTV/TLTV > 80% and ≤ 95% | LTV/TLTV > 95% |
|---------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| 1-unit properties | None | None | None |
| 2–4-unit properties | None | 3% of value | 3% of value |
| Manufactured Homes | None | None | None |

> **Note:** “Value” refers to the lesser of the purchase price or appraised value per §4203.1(a).

---

## (b) Reserves  

**Not required** for:
- **Accept Mortgages** secured by 1-unit properties (unless Loan Product Advisor® specifies reserves to offset risk), and  
- **Manually Underwritten Mortgages** secured by 1-unit properties.  

For **2–4-unit properties**, the Seller must **verify reserves** if required by Loan Product Advisor, as stated on the **Last Feedback Certificate**.
