Section: 4502.5 – Maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV)/Total LTV (TLTV)/HELOC TLTV (HTLTV) Ratios and Value for Community Land Trust Mortgages  
Effective Date: 05/07/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section defines how to determine the **maximum allowable LTV, TLTV, and HTLTV ratios** and how to calculate **property value** for **Community Land Trust (CLT) Mortgages**.  
The valuation is based on the **leasehold interest**—that is, the property interest held by the Borrower under the CLT ground lease.

---

## (a) Maximum LTV/TLTV/HTLTV Ratios  

- The **LTV**, **TLTV**, and **HTLTV** ratios must be calculated using the **appraised value of the leasehold interest**, **excluding resale and other restrictions** contained in the CLT ground lease.  
- For purchase and “no cash-out” refinance transactions, the applicable **maximum LTV/TLTV/HTLTV ratios** are found in **Section 4203.1(b)**.  
- For **cash-out refinance Mortgages**, the **maximum ratio is 65%**.

### Summary Table

| Transaction Type | Basis of Calculation | Maximum Ratio |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Purchase | Appraised value of leasehold interest (without restrictions) | Per §4203.1(b) |
| “No cash-out” Refinance | Same as above | Per §4203.1(b) |
| Cash-out Refinance | Same as above | **65%** |

---

## (b) Value Determination  

- For **both purchase and refinance transactions**, the term **“value”** refers to the **appraised value of the Mortgaged Premises** as of the **Note Date**.  
- The appraisal must comply with **Section 4502.6** (Appraisal Requirements for CLT Mortgages).

### LTV Ratio Formula

\[
LTV = \frac{\text{First Lien Mortgage Amount}}{\text{Appraised Value}}
\]

#### Example:
| Item | Amount |
|------|---------|
| Appraised Value | $300,000 |
| Purchase Price | $225,000 |
| Subsidy Amount | $75,000 |
| First Lien Mortgage Amount | $225,000 |
| **LTV Ratio** | **75%** |

> **Note:**  
> - The **purchase price excludes** any subsidy used to acquire the property.  
> - Therefore, the purchase price may not reflect true market value.  
> - The **minimum Borrower contribution for Down Payment** (if required) is determined by the applicable product type in **Section 5501.3(k)**.

## Compliance Summary  

| Rule | Description | Reference |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Appraised value basis | Excludes CLT resale and use restrictions | §4502.5(a) |
| Cash-out LTV limit | 65% maximum | §4502.5(a) |
| Appraisal requirement | Must follow §4502.6 | §4502.5(b) |
| Down Payment contribution | Determined by product type when LTV > 80% | §5501.3(k) |
