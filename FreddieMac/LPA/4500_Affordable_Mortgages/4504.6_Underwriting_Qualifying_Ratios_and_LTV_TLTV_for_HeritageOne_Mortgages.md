Section: 4504.6 – Underwriting Requirements, Qualifying Ratios and Maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV)/Total LTV (TLTV) Ratios for HeritageOne® Mortgages  
Effective Date: 03/05/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section outlines the **underwriting**, **qualifying ratio**, and **maximum LTV/TLTV ratio** requirements for **HeritageOne® Mortgages**, including both Accept and Manually Underwritten loans. These standards balance risk management with access to credit for eligible Native American Borrowers purchasing or refinancing homes in Tribal Areas.

---

## (a) Underwriting  

### Loan Type Requirements
- The Mortgage must be either:
  - An **Accept Mortgage** (Loan Product Advisor® “Accept” recommendation), or  
  - A **Manually Underwritten Mortgage**
- **Mortgages secured by 2–4 unit properties must be Accept Mortgages** (manual underwriting not permitted for these).

### Credit Reputation Standards (Manual Underwriting)
For Manually Underwritten HeritageOne® Mortgages:
- Each Borrower individually, and all Borrowers collectively, must have an **acceptable credit reputation** per **Topics 5100 and 5200**.  
- A Borrower with **insufficient credit history** may still be deemed acceptable if:
  - No evidence of derogatory credit (liens, judgments, collections) appears in the Mortgage file; **and**
  - At least one other Borrower with documented income and assets has an acceptable credit reputation.

If such a Borrower contributes income:
- Their contribution **may count toward qualifying income**, but **must not exceed 30%** of the total qualifying income.

### Minimum Indicator Scores
| Property / Mortgage Type | Minimum Indicator Score |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1-unit purchase | **660** |
| 1-unit “no cash-out” refinance | **680** |
| Manufactured Homes | **680** |

> See **Exhibit 25** for complete Indicator Score references.

## (b) Qualifying Ratios  

### Housing Expense Ratio
- No maximum **monthly housing expense-to-income ratio**, **except** for manually underwritten Mortgages with non-occupying Borrowers (see §5103.1).

### Debt Payment-to-Income (DTI) Ratio  
| Underwriting Type | Maximum DTI | Notes |
|--------------------|-------------|-------|
| Loan Product Advisor® (Accept) | Determined by LPA feedback | — |
| Manually Underwritten 1-unit | **45%** | See §5103.1 if non-occupying Borrower |
| Manufactured Homes (Caution) | **36%** | See §5401.2 for DTI underwriting rules |

---

## (c) Maximum LTV/TLTV Ratios  

### Calculation Basis
- Value used for LTV/TLTV must follow **Section 4203.1(a)** (appraised value or purchase price, whichever is less).

### Maximum Ratios
| Property / Mortgage Type | Max LTV/TLTV | Notes |
|---------------------------|--------------|-------|
| 1-unit properties | **97%** | Up to 105% TLTV if Affordable Second® applies |
| 2–4 unit properties | **95%** | Up to 105% TLTV if Affordable Second® applies |
| CHOICEHomes® | **97%** | — |
| Manufactured Homes | See **Chapter 5703** | — |

> For Manufactured Homes on leasehold estates (if permitted), see **Section 5706.5**.  
> For Condominium Units, maximum ratios may be **lower** based on project review type (see **Chapter 5701**).
