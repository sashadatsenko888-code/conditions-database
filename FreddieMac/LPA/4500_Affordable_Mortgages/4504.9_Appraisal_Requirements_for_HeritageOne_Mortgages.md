Section: 4504.9 – Appraisal Requirements for HeritageOne® Mortgages  
Effective Date: 03/05/2025  

> **Condition-Relevant Section — Include in Ruleset**

---

## Overview  
This section defines Freddie Mac’s **appraisal standards for HeritageOne® Mortgages**, including appraiser competency in Tribal Areas, appraisal type and methodology, valuation flexibility, and submission requirements through the **Uniform Collateral Data Portal® (UCDP®)**.  

---

## (a) Appraiser Qualifications  

The Seller must ensure:  
- The **appraiser meets Section 5603.1 qualifications** and  
- Has **specific experience with Tribal Areas**, including:  
  - Tribal trust land,  
  - Allotted trust land, and  
  - Fee simple (restricted or unrestricted) interests.  

The appraiser must have access to all relevant data sources — including those from the **Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)** and the **Eligible Native American Tribe** governing the subject property’s location — to develop a **well-supported and documented opinion of value**.  

---

## (b) Appraisal Type, ACE Eligibility, and ACE+ PDR Eligibility  

- The appraisal must follow **Topic 5600**.  
- Unless an **ACE appraisal waiver** or **ACE+ PDR** is accepted under §§ 5602.3 or 5602.4:  
  - An **interior + exterior inspection report** is required; and  
  - The Seller must retain **all property valuation documentation** in the Mortgage file.  

---

## (c) Appraised Value Representation and Warranty Relief  

A Mortgage with an appraisal using the **sales comparison approach** may be eligible for **Loan Collateral Advisor® representation and warranty relief**, if all conditions in § 5602.2 are met.  

---

## (d) Appraisal Cost Offset Credit  

- When a traditional appraisal report is required, Freddie Mac provides an **appraisal cost offset credit**.  
- This credit **must be passed through to the Borrower**, and details will appear in the Seller’s Purchase Documents.  

---

## (e) Sales Comparison Approach and Cost Approach  

### Standard Rule  
- Use the **sales comparison approach** (supported by cost or income approach) whenever **≥ 3 closed comparable sales** are available.  
- Comparables may be **older, farther, or less similar** if justified under § 5605.6.  

### Exception — Market Areas Lacking Comparables  
If sufficient comparable sales are unavailable, an appraisal **relying solely on the cost approach** is acceptable **only if** the appraiser:  
1. Provides a **fully developed cost approach**, including:  
   - Completed cost approach section,  
   - Enough detail for Seller replication, and  
   - Clear reconciliation of final value.  
2. Uses **revised Freddie Mac scope of work**, **assumptions**, and **certifications** (as defined in Seller’s Purchase Documents).  
3. Completes all other required report fields **except** the comparable sales grid data.  

> **Prohibited** — Sole cost approach may **not** be used if the Mortgage is secured by:  
> - A property with resale restrictions that terminate at foreclosure/deed-in-lieu,  
> - A Condominium Unit,  
> - A 2–4-unit property, or  
> - A property with an ADU.  

---

## (f) Additional Form Instructions  

For cost-approach-only appraisals:  
- The report must include the **identifier “Heritage1”** in the **“File #”** field.  
- The appraiser must still complete the following fields in the sales comparison grid:  
  - Location  
  - View  
  - Quality of Construction  
  - Condition  
  - Gross Living Area  

---

## (g) Site Value  

- For **fee simple** properties relying solely on the cost approach, a **site value** must be determined and reported.  
- For **leasehold Mortgages**, when **no ground rent is due** and **no upfront payment was made**, the **leased fee value = $0** (no land value).  

---

## (h) Uniform Collateral Data Portal (UCDP®)  

If an appraisal report is obtained:  
- It must be **submitted to UCDP**, and  
- Must receive a **“Successful” status** prior to loan delivery.  

---

## (i) Additional Resources  

Freddie Mac encourages Sellers to use the **Appraisal Institute’s training curriculum** on property valuation in Tribal Areas.
